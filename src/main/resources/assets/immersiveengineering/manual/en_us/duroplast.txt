Duroplast
It's fantastic!
<&resin>
Duroplast is a synthetic plastic created from TD: LINK RESIN. This incredible new material is rigid, non-flammable and not conductive, making it an excellent insulator in electrical engineering.

The easy moldability of plastic resins also allows it to be created into a variety of shapes, such as sheets and blocks.
<&duroplast_sheet>Duroplast items are created by filling appropriate <link;metal_press;molds;mold_recipes> with resin in the <link;bottling_machine;§o§nBottling §o§nMachine§r>. The machine is able to confer enough heat and pressure within these molds to trigger the resin to harden.<br>
The resulting sheets are used in the creation of <link;components;Advanced Electronic Components;elec_components> and <link;components;Circuit Backplanes;pcb>, where they act as insulators.<np>
<&duroplast_block>Solid blocks of duroplast can be used for construction and decorational purposes, though not everyone appreciates their colour. More importantly however, they serve to replace §2Terracotta§r when crafting <link;wiring;wire connectors and relays;connector_recipes>, thus reducing the amount of clay required!<np>
<&fiberboard>Fiberboard is made from compressed <link;sawmill;sawdust;sawdust>, mixed with resin to create a dense and compressed block. It shares its properties with wood and can be used as a replacement for planks in most recipes. An excellent way to recycle what would otherwise be waste!
<&empty_shell> You can also use resin in the creation of empty shells for the <link;bullets;Revolver's cartridges;empty>, making them cheaper and easier to mass produce.
