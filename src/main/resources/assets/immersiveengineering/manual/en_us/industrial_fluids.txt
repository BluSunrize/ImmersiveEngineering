Industrial Fluids
In the Valley of the Drums
<&creosote_oil>§lCreosote Oil§r is a thick, viscous fluid that comes from the destructive pyrolysis of §lCoal§r into <link;coke_and_graphite;Coal Coke>.<br>
It is used for a variety of products including <link;treated_wood;Treated Wood> and can be burnt in the <link;diesel_generator;Diesel Generator>.<np>
<&redstone_acid>§lRedstone Acid§r is a powerful acid produced by dissolving the acidic salt redstone in water.<br>
While the exact properties of Redstone remain a mystery even to the most studied engineers, it behaves as an electrolyte incredibly favorably.<np>
<&redstone_acid_mixer>The acid is not strong enough to dissolve organic matter, but it is mildly corrosive to metal and acts as an excellent electrolyte for <link;accumulators;Accumulators;recipes>.<br>
For mass production, the acid can be easily created in a <link;mixer;Mixer>, using 1 piece of §2Redstone Dust§r for one quarter of a bucket of water.<br>
<&redstone_acid_copper>When used in a <link;chemical_thrower;Chemical Thrower> or in a <link;bottling_machine;Bottling Machine> it can be used to oxidize copper blocks.<br>
The bottling recipe consumes an eighth of a bucket for each block oxidized.<np>
<&plant_oil_ethanol>§lPlant Oil§r and §lEthanol§r are plant-derived fuels primarily used in <link;industrial_fluids;Biodiesel;biodiesel>.<br>
Ethanol can also be used as a precursor to <link;industrial_fluids;Acetaldehyde;resin_and_acetaldehyde>. Plant Oil can also be used to lubricate the bearings of large tools.<np>
<&biodiesel>§lBiodiesel§r is the great prime mover of any aspiring industrial engineer, and created from <link;industrial_fluids;Plant Oil and Ethanol;plant_oil_ethanol> in the <link;refinery;Refinery>.<br>
When burned in the <link;diesel_generator;Diesel Generator>, biodiesel will produce truly industrial amounts of power.<np>
<&high_power_biodiesel>To increase the energy output of §lBiodiesel§r further, it can be combined with a <link;industrial_fluids;Potion of Strength;potion> in the <link;refinery;Refinery> at 95 to 5 ratio. The resulting §lHigh-Cetane Biodiesel§r has a 25% longer burn time!<np>
<&resin_acetaldehyde>§lPhenolic Resin§r and §lAcetaldehyde§r are primary constituents of the plastic <link;resin_and_duroplast;Duroplast;duroplast>.<br>
The recipes for production involving these chemical precursors can be found <link;resin_and_duroplast;in later sections>.<np>
<&herbicide>§lHerbicide§r is a chemical with rather poisonous effects to local plant life.<br>
When loaded into a <link;chemical_thrower;Chemical Thrower> it is dispersed as a fine mist, which withers and destroys any plants it comes in contact with.<np>
<&herbicide_mixing>The fluid will remove leaves from trees, destroy flowers, bushes and crops and strip the grass from dirt. It will also dehydrate and ruin farmland.<br>
To craft Herbicide, mix half a bucket of <link;fermenter;Ethanol> with §2Copper Dust§r and §2Sulfur Dust§r in the <link;mixer;Mixer>.<np>
<&potion>§lPotions§r can be bucketed and produced en masse using the <link;mixer;Mixer>.<br>
This allows for the production of buffs without the use of copious amounts of §lBlaze Powder§r and at a higher efficiency.
