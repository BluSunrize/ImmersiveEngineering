Lightning Rod
Thunderstruck!
Lightning is a phenomenon of nature. It contains a huge amount of raw power, and this lightning rod is able to harness that power.<br>
Stacking steel fences on the port at the top of the rod increases the changes that lightning hits it during rain or thunder. The chance of a strike can be increased further by widening the rod into a net at its top.<br>
When the steel pole is struck, the huge amounts of energy created are stored in the base of the lightning rod and then slowly distributed to the energy connections at the sides.
