Sulfur and Nitrate
Explosions & Growth
§lSulfur Dust§r is a powder found in certain ores and commonly in <link;minerals;Mineral Deposits>. It can be found occasionally by <link;crusher;crushing> §2Lapis Lazuli§r or §2Coal Ore§r blocks and more commonly in §2Nether Quartz Ore§r. It can also be extracted from §2Blaze Rods§r.

§lNitrate Dust§r (also known as saltpeter) is mixture of alkali salts found by processing §2Sandstone§r in a <link;crusher;Crusher>.
<&fertilizer>
Sulfur, slag, and nitrate by themselves are a small boost to growing crops in the <link;garden_cloche;Garden Cloche>, but are not enough to be used on crops directly.

§2Industrial Fertilizer§r will provide a major boost to the cloche, and is made from all three nutrients above plus water to mix them effectively.
<&gunpowder>
Mixing Nitrate, Sulfur and Charcoal allows for the creation of gunpowder, a far more industrial and consistent process than looting it from monsters.

Gunpowder can also be made into Gunpowder Barrels, a more stable alternative to TNT.
