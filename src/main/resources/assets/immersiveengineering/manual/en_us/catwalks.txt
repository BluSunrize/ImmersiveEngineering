Catwalks
OSHA Compliant!
<&catwalk_recipes>Catwalks are a more safe structure for the upper floors of a factory, because unlike <link;scaffolding_and_ladders;scaffolding>, they can be equipped with railings.
When sneaking and using an §2Engineer's Hammer§r on the catwalk, it will add or remove the railing on the respective side.<br>
On metal catwalks, the railing can also be colored by using any dye on them.
