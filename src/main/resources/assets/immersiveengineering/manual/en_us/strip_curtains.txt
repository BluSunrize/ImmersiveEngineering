Strip Curtains
???
<&recipe>Strip Curtains are a bar with panels of <link;industrial_hemp;Tough Fabric;fabric_recipe> mounted to them and hung down.<br>
Curtains can be used to block sight through doorways or conveyor openings without obstructing items or creatures.<br>\
When an item or creature passes through them, they will emit a redstone signal. Rightclick them with an Engineer's Screwdriver to enable strong signals.<br>
They can be dyed in the same way leather armor can.
