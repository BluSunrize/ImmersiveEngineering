Power Generation

<&dynamo_recipe>Transferring power is quite helpful provided you have power. To actually generate Flux, you can use the kinetic forces of windmills and waterwheels. Connecting these to a dynamo will generate power based on how fast they turn.<np>
<&waterwheel_recipes>The Water Wheel is a fairly easy way of powering a dynamo. It's turning speed is based on the water flowing around it, so for optimal results, you'll want to direct the water in a semi-circle from the top down one side and along the bottom. Up to three water wheels can be placed against each other.<np>
<&windmill_recipes>The Windmill is a free and easy way of generating power, albeit not a very powerful one. Its speed depends on the space in front of it, with its kinetic output reducing greatly if the airflow is obscured. Additionally, weather conditions like rain or thunderstorms result in stronger winds and increased rotation speeds.<np>
<&sail_recipe>Your wind-based power generation can be improved by covering the blades of your windmill in cloth. Doing so increases the surface area and with it the rotation speed and energy output.
The required sails are crafted from <link;hemp;tough hemp fabric;start> and applied to the windmill by rightclicking it in world.
