Ear Defenders
LOUD NOISES!
<&recipe>Ear Defenders are devices for protecting your hearing. They are quite important for engineers that work in close proximity to <link;diesel_generator;Diesel Generators;> or other loud machinery.<br>
While wearing Ear Defenders, all noises are reduced by 90% and they make your ears considerably more warm and fuzzy! :D<br>
Placing the Ear Defenders in the <link;engineers_workbench;Engineer's Workbench;> allows you to specify which types of noises you want cancelled and by how much their volume should be reduced.<np>
<&color_and_armor>
Crafting them with any other helmet will attach the defenders to that piece of equipment, crafting the helmet alone will remove the defenders again, to allow further customizing.<br>
Ear defenders can be dyed the same as leather armor.
