Engineer's Skyhook
Booker, catch!
The Engineer's Skyhook is a motorized grabber system designed to hook onto wires, hemp ropes or steel cables.
With it, engineers can quickly traverse the length of a powerline to move between substations or other installations. Simply hold the right mouse button while close to a wire and you will be attached to it.
The button can be released while riding the wire, but letting go of the skyhook or sneaking will cause you to dismount.

Gravity will be sufficient to move along decending wires at a decent speed, the standard movement keys can be used to move along ascending wires.
When the skyhook reaches an intersection it will continue in as close to the direction the player is looking as possible.
