Fluid Transport
Professional Plumber
<&pipe_recipe>Transporting fluids has become quite essential in the engineering business. Fluid Pipes and Fluid Pumps do exactly that. On their own, Fluid Pipes are quite slow at transferring fluids, but if a pump is used to insert the fluid, it'll move much faster.<np>
You can rightclick the connection piece of a pipe with an Engineer's Hammer to prevent it from connecting to that side.
Fluid Pipes can be covered with wooden or steel scaffolding. Simply rightclick a piece of scaffolding onto a pipe to cover it. Break the pipe to retrieve the scaffolding.
Additionally, rightclicking a pipe with any dye will color it, to easily identify where it is going. Colored pipes won't automatically connect to newly placed ones.<np>
<&pump_recipe>Fluid Pumps have three essential functions. They can be used to insert into pipes at high pressure, to transfer fluids much faster, or they can pick up fluids from the world.
Using you hammer on the base of the pump will switch the sides between in- and output.<np>
In order for the pump to pick up fluid blocks, it will need a power input at the top and a redstone signal. Pumps can also be used to extract from tanks and other fluid containers that do not have an automatic output. This will also require a redstone signal, but won't consume power.<np>
Water blocks will serve as an infinite fluid source for the pump, as long as more than 3 blocks are connected.

Fluid blocks that were picked up will be replaced with cobblestone to reduce lag of flowing fluids. This behavior can be toggled off and on by using an Engineer's Hammer on the pump.<np>
<&outlet_recipe>The Fluid Outlet acts as an endpoint for a pipe system, allowing Fluid to be placed in the world. The sides can be configured between input, output (open gate) or closed, a redstone signal can be used to turn the outlet off. The block will only ever output fluid up to its own heightlevel.
