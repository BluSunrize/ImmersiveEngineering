Thermoelectric Generator
Hot and Cold
<&recipe>Thermoelectric Generators are another kind of power generation, and work without the use of any mechanical parts. These generators use the temperature gradient between two opposing sources to produce power.<np>
Placing a heat source on one side and a colder source on the opposite side generates energy based on the difference between the two temperatures.<br>
Any fluid will work based on its temperature, along with some other blocks.<br>
Temperature gradients are only used across the generator, not across adjacent sides.<np>
<&values>The list below contains non-fluid blocks which can be used as sources of temperature.
