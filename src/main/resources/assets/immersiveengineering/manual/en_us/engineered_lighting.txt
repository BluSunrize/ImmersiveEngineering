Engineered Lighting
Lighting up the Wasteland
<&lantern>Deep in the halls of the factories, it can be quite dark. Lanterns can help illuminate the machines, providing almost as much light as a glowstone block would.
<&cagelamp>Cage lamps are a little more rugged and atmospheric than lanterns, while also providing redstone control if desired. By default, a cage lamp requires a redstone signal to turn on, but this behavior can be inverted by right-clicking them with an Engineer's Screwdriver.
<&electric_lantern>Powered Lanterns are one of the first ever invented uses for electric power.<br>
To run these, they need to be connected directly to a power grid using LV wires. They will allow power to be transferred through them, allowing multiple of them to be linked in a row.
Using the Engineer's Hammer on them will flip them upside down.<br>
As long as they are supplied with a little bit of power, they will light up the surrounding area like a normal Lantern, but additionally, they will also prevent hostile mobs to spawn in a 32 block radius!<np>
<&floodlight>Floodlights are strong lightsources. While they require more power than a simple Powered Lantern, they will create a cone of light up to 32 blocks long.<br>
Use an Engineer's Hammer on the top or bottom faces of the block to rotate the light or click its sides to change its pitch.<br>
Generally, Floodlights require a redstone signal to run, however their control-behavior can be inverted by right-clicking their base with an Engineer's Screwdriver.
