Thermoelectric Generator
Hot and Cold
<&recipe>Thermoelectric Generators are another option of power generation and work without the use of any mechanical parts, instead they use the temperature gradients between two sources.
Placing a hot fluid on one side and a colder fluid on the opposing side generates energy based on the difference between the two temperatures.
<&values>The list below contains other, non-fluid blocks, which can be used as sources of temperature.
