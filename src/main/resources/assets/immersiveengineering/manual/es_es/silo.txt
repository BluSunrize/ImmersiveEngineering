Silo
Full to the brim!
Silos offer space for a lot of items of the same type, making them excellent for mass storage of seeds, slag or cobblestone. They have space for 41472 items, equaling the capacity of 24 chests.
Items must be input through the top and extracted from the bottom. Applying a redstone signal to the bottom block will make it output automatically.
A comparator attached to the bottom center block will it emit a redstone signal proportional to how full the silo is. Attaching the comparator to one of the top 6 layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator. For example, a comparator attached to the third layer of a silo would not emit any signal until the tank is 2/6 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the silo is half full or more.
