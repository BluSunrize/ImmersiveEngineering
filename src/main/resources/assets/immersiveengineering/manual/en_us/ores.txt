<&alu>§lBauxite Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.bauxite.min_y> and <config;i;ores.bauxite.max_y>, and requires a Stone Pickaxe to harvest.
The raw ore will smelt into aluminium ingots, which is an integral part of high-voltage architecture.
<&lead>§lLead Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.lead.min_y> and <config;i;ores.lead.max_y>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.
The raw ore will smelt into lead ingots, which are used in creating early accumulators.
<&silver>§lSilver Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.silver.min_y> and <config;i;ores.silver.max_y>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.
The raw ore will smelt into silver ingots, which alloy with gold to create electrum, a far more effective conductor.
<&nickel>§lNickel Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.nickel.min_y> and <config;i;ores.nickel.max_y>, but more abundantly below <config;i;ores.deep_nickel.max_y>. It requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.
The raw ore will smelt into nickel ingots, which alloy with copper to create constantan, a heat resistant conductor used in the construction of <link;thermoelectric;Thermoelectric Generators;start>.
<&uranium>§lUranium Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.uranium.min_y> and <config;i;ores.uranium.max_y>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.
The raw ore will smelt into uranium ingots, but there are currently not many uses for the metal. A uranium block can serve as a heatsource for the <link;thermoelectric;Thermoelectric Generator;start> and the metal will be used in future endeavours.
