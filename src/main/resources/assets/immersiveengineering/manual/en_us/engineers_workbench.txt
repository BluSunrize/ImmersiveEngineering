Engineer's Workbench
Always cluttered
The Engineer's Workbench is a professional worktable for the educated engineer. It is widely used to create items described by <link;blueprints;Engineer's Blueprints>.<br>
A wide variety of blueprints can be crafted, as detailed <link;blueprints;here>, whereas a few select ones can only be discovered in the world or bought from villagers.<np>
To use a blueprint in the Workbench, put it in the slot on the left of the GUI and the necessary ingredients in the six slots in the middle.<br>
The resulting items can then be retrieved from the right side. Hovering your mouse over these output slots will inform you exactly which materials are needed for each item.<np>
A secondary function of the Workbench is the modification and configuration of more complex tools and gadgets. The <link;mining_drill;Mining Drill>, <link;shield;Heavy Plated Shield> or <link;revolver;Revolver> are examples of such items.<br>
When placed in the main slot of the workbench, it's use becomes that of modifying these tools by inserting applicable upgrades into the new slots that appear.
