Metal Barrel
Doesn't roll
Metal barrels work exactly like <link;barrel;Wooden Barrels;>. They store the same amount of fluid and their in- and outputs are configured the same way, but unlike the wooden version, these can store gasses and hot fluids, and won't output automatically if they are disabled by a redstone signal.
