<&recipe>The Coke Oven is the first important machine that needs to be constructed in order to proceed with any industrial progress.<br>
The Coke Oven is a simple machine: it heats up fuels in a low-oxygen environment in the middle of the brick oven, pyrolyzing them into carbon-rich versions of the fuel, such as §2Coal Coke§r, or §2Charcoal§r.<br>
Just as important is the waste from this process, <link;industrial_fluids;Creosote Oil;creosote_oil>, which is used as a <link;treated_wood;preservative for wood>. This preserved wood can be used to construct all manner of sturdy machines and is used throughout industry.<br>
The Coke Oven cannot output the oil by itself, and it must be extracted by <link;fluid_pump;Fluid Pump>.<np>
