Workbench & Blueprints
Always cluttered
The Engineer's Workbench is a professional worktable for the educated engineer. It is widely used to construct the items described in <link;blueprints;Engineer's Blueprints>.
A wide variety of blueprints can be crafted, as detailed in the respective manual entry, whereas a few select ones can only be discovered in the world or purchased from villagers.
To use a blueprint in the Workbench, put it in the slot on the left of the GUI and the necessary ingredients in the six slots in the middle. The resulting items can then be retrieved from the right side. Hovering your mouse over these output slots will inform you exactly which materials are needed for each item.<np>
A secondary function of the Workbench is the modification and configuration of more complex tools and gadgets. The <link;mining_drill;Mining Drill>, <link;shield;Heavy Plated Shield> or <link;revolver;Revolver> are examples of such items. When placed in the main slot of the workbench, it's use becomes that of modifying these tools by inserting applicable upgrades into the new slots that appear.
