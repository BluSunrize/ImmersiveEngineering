Buzzsaw
We Don't Go To Ravenholm
<&recipes>This large, portable buzzsaw is designed to make quick work of trees and other pieces of foliage that may stand in the way of a pristine factory building.
After using the <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start> to place a sawblade in it, and loading it with  <link;refinery;Biodiesel;start> or another fuel, it can be used to carve through everything from small birches to large jungle trees.

Like some other tools, the buzzsaw can be modified in the <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench>. These upgrades affect the size of the internal tank and the durability of its sawblade.

<&tank_recipe>The §2Large Tank§r increases the fluid capacity of the buzzsaw by 2000 mb.<np>
<&lube_recipe>The §2Advanced Lubrication System§r applies additional lubricant to the sawblade, reducing the speed at which it loses durability.<np>
