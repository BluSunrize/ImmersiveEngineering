Wooden Barrel
Doesn't roll
<&recipe>Wooden barrels are simple containers that can store fluid. They will store up to 12 buckets, but because they are wooden, they can't store any gasses or hot fluids.
Rightclicking the top or bottom side of the barrel with a Hammer will switch between in-, output or no connection.
