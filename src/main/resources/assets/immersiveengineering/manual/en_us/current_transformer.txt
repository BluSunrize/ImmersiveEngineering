Current Transformer
88 Flux per hour!
The Current Transformer is a measurement device for electrical throughput.<br>
It can be hooked up in any powerline and will keep track of energy transferred through it, returning an average Flux/t upon rightclick.<br>
If a comparator is attached to the base of the transformer, it will output a signal from 0-15 depending upon the fill ratio of the wire's maximum transfer rate.
