Machine Interface
Querying Complex Conditions Quickly
<&recipe>With the increasing complexity of multiblock machinery, keeping track of their needs becomes quite complex.
While <link;redstone_wiring;comparator signals;probe> can provide some insight into the amount of items inside, only the Machine Interface can provide a more detailed evaluation and send redstone signals.

When placed against the redstone control surface of a multiblock, opening the GUI will allow you to configure a variety of conditions by which to output a signal.
Press the "Add Condition" button to add a new row. Within that row, the first button serves to delete it again, the second one is for configuring the signal color to output on.
This is followed by two dropdown menus, one for selecting the type of check (such as "Machine Active", "Item Input", "Fluid Output") and one for selecting the condition.
Most checks support "Comparator Output" for a signal strength that is scaled to the items/fluid/energy stored. But you can also choose from true or false options, such as "75% Filled" or "Empty".
As soon as a condition is matched, the Machine Interface will output the relevant signal on the configured color-channel to any attached <link;redstone_wiring;Redstone Interface Connector;bundled>.

In addition to sending, the Machine Interface can also receive a redstone signal and output it to the connected machine. The signal color for that is configured in the bottom-right-hand corner of the GUI.
This allows you to make use of the <link;logic_unit;Logic Unit> to evaluate the signals coming from the machine and then send one back to enable or disable it!
