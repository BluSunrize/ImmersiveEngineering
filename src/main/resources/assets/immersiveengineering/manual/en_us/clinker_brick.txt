The art of baking bricks has progressed past wasting several parts of the batch producing clinker for being too close to the fire.

Those looking to recreate the iconic look of clinker brick facades may, however, heat bricks in the §2Smoker§r to vitrify and char the external bricks, turning them into §2Clinker Bricks§r.
<&variants>
To complement the look of facades made from them, clinker bricks can be combined with terracotta to produce several decorative variants for facades: §2Clinker Brick Quoins§r and §2Sills§r.

Clinker Bricks can also be formed into stairs, slabs, and walls.

§2Clinker Brick Walls§r have a small sill of baked brick on the top-most layer.
