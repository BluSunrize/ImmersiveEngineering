Arc Furnace
Not a reactor
The Arc Furnace is a massive machine used to quickly alloy metals and smelt ores. It consists of supports and a steel and firebrick vat topped by electrodes to heat the vat.<np>
Arc furnaces can smelt batches of many items at once, but are little faster than their <link;improved_blast_furnace;simpler sisters> at the cost of larger amounts of power. Thus, they excel at speed for big orders.<br>
As a consequence of the order of magnitude increase in speed from parallel smelting, the Arc Furnace is a complex machine that requires hand maintenance in the form of replacement of the electrodes. This maintenance cannot be performed automatically.<np>
Once the electrodes are used for approximately four continuous days of smelting, they become degraded enough that they break.<br>
To form the structure, assemble it as shown on the first page, then click the cauldron with an Engineer's Hammer.<br>
Energy is input through the three connectors at the back, and supplying the control panel at the front with a redstone signal will turn off the machine.<br>
 Outputs are retrieved from the basin at the front of the structure, slag through the port at the center back. The Arc Furnace will automatically push outputs and slag to connected receptacles.<br>
Right-clicking the panel, cauldron, or vat will open the interface.<np>
§lInterface:§r
The three slots at the top are for the <link;coke_and_graphite;Graphite Electrodes;electrode>.<br>
The twelve slots on the left are the input slots for metals and ores. Each slot has a temperature bar next to it, representing the progress of smelting.<br>
The button in the top left of the screen changes whether items are spread across the arc furnace or concentrated in one point in the vat.<br>
The four slots on the right are for "additives", different materials added to the molten metal during the crafting process. An example of these would be adding Coke Dust to melting Iron in order to create Steel.<br>
Inputs and additives are inserted through the two hatches at the top of the structure, inputs to the left and additives to the right of the electrodes.<br>
The seven slots at the bottom are six output slots and a slot for slag, on the bottom right.
