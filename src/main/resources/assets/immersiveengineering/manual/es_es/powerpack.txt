Capacitor Backpack
Do....Ray....Egon!
Energy storage takes space and some heavy weight components. As such, storing large amounts of energy in each tool individually is inefficient and makes them akward to wield.
The Capacitor Backpack acts as a compromise, offering a centralized storage of energy for any powered tools to tap into.
The backpack charges any tools held in main- or offhand as well as any armorpieces you are wearing.
The capacitor can be worn on your back like a piece of chest armor, or you may attach it to most common sets of armor in order to gain the benefit of a power-supply as well as protection.
