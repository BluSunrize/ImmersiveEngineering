Conveyor Belts
Who needs rails anyway?
<&conveyor_recipes>Conveyor Belts are an easy way of transporting all sorts of things around your base. While they are strong enough to move living creatures like cows or sheep, their true strength lies in transporting items.
Throwing items atop them will have the items move along the belt. Should the belt lead into an inventory, the item will be inserted.
Blocks like hoppers will be able to drop items onto the belts (rightclick) or adjust whether they should run up- or downwards (sneak + rightclick).
Rightclicking a conveyor with any dye will colour the walls of the conveyor to easily identify where is is going.<np>
<&conveyor_redstone_recipe>The Redstone Controlled Conveyor Belt can be disabled with a redstone signal.
The panel on its side allows attaching a lever, but a redstone signal may be input from any direction. Sneak + rightclick with an Engineer's Hammer to move the panel to the other side.<np>
<&conveyor_dropper_recipe>The Dropping Conveyor Belt is quite simply a conveyor with a hatch in the middle, allowing it to drop items that pass over it downwards.
Items will be inserted into inventories below or simply dropped if there is an empty space below the conveyor.
The hatch can be shut with a redstone signal, when desired.<np>
<&conveyor_extract_recipe>The Extracting Conveyor Belt possesses the ability to extract items from an inventory in a similar fashion to a Hopper. Unlike the latter however, it possesses no internal inventory and will place extracted items onto the belt.
Sneak + rightclick with an Engineer's Hammer to change its input side. Use the Engineer's Screwdriver to adjust the speed at which it extracts.<np>
<&conveyor_vertical_recipe>The Vertical Conveyor Belt is a belt meant to be mounted on walls. Using the buckets attached to is, it will lift entities straight up. Despite the use of the term "bucket", it will not lift fluids.
This belt can insert into inventories above it or simply expel items over the edge at the top onto more conveyors.<np>
<&conveyor_splitter_recipe>The Splitting Conveyor Belt alternates between redirecting Items and Entities left and right, plain and simple. This feature can be used to achieve a more equal distribution in your factories.<np>
<&conveyor_covered_recipe>The Covered Conveyor Belt works just like a normal conveyor, however it is covered by a piece of scaffolding, which prevents players from picking up items from it.
You can rightclick it with other types of scaffold or glass to change the cover's appearance.<np>
<&conveyor_other_covered_recipes>Similarly, the Dropping, Extracting, Splitting and Vertical Conveyors can also be covered in scaffolding to achieve the same benefits of "pickup-prevention" while still functioning as they normally do.
<&chute_recipes>Chutes are simple constructions made from sheetmetal that allow entities to drop down straight.
They can insert into inventories below them and be inserted into by conveyors or similar devices. Items within them won't be picked up by players and should be immune to most forms of attraction, magnetic or magical.
Sneak + rightclick with an Engineer's Hammer to turn the chute into a corner piece that directs an entity to the side.
