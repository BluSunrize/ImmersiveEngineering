Engineer's Skyhook
Booker, catch!
The Engineer's Skyhook is a motorized grabber system designed to hook onto wires, hemp ropes or steel cables.<br>
With it, engineers can quickly traverse the length of a powerline to move between substations or other sites.<np>
Simply hold the right mouse button while close to a wire and you will be attached to it.<br>
The button can be released while riding the wire, but letting go of the skyhook or sneaking will cause you to dismount.<br>
Gravity will be sufficient to move along decending wires at a decent speed, the standard movement keys can be used to move along ascending wires.<br>
When the skyhook reaches an intersection it will continue in as close to the direction the player is looking as possible.
