Industrial Dyes
Definitely Perfectly Harmless
Metal compounds have many uses in industrial dyes, and the most useful of these is lead.

Lead compounds can be crafted into large quantities of red and white dye.

Yellow dye has not been produced in quantity from lead, as several ingredients cannot be found in quantity to make lead chromate.
<&lead_white>By combining the carbon dioxide fumes from rotting material and the acetic acid from spoiled ethanol, lead metal can be crafted into §lLead Carbonate§r, commonly known as Lead White.

Dye produced this way can be made without the need to farm copious numbers of skeletons to grind their bones.
<&lead_red>By oxidizing lead metal nuggets in a §2Furnace§r at high temperature, lead metal can be converted into §lLead Oxide§r, more commonly known as Red Lead.

This dye can be produced without the need for a flower farm or the cloche for copious amounts of red flowers.
