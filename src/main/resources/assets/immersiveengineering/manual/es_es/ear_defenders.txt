Ear Defenders
LOUD NOISES!
<&recipe>Ear Defenders are devices for protecting your hearing. They are quite important for engineers that work in close proximity to <link;diesel_generator;Diesel Generators;> or other loud machinery.
While wearing Ear Defenders, all noises are reduced by 90% and they make your ears considerably more warm and fuzzy! :D
<&color_and_armor>Placing the Ear Defenders in the <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;> allows you to specify which types of noises you want cancelled and by how much their volume should be reduced.
You can dye them like you would leather armor.
Crafting them with any other helmet will attach the defenders to that piece of equipment, crafting the helmet alone will remove the defenders again, to allow further customizing.
