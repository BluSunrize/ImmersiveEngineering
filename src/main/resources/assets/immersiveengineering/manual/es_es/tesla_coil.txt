Tesla Coil
This one goes up to 11
<&tesla_coil_recipe>The Tesla Coil started as a concept of wireless energy transfer. However, due to its potentially high loss rates and its rather interesting property of frying every living being in a 6 meter radius, it was quickly converted into an Engineer's dream of home defense.<np>
The upkeep cost of this machine is high, clocking in at a regular 256 Flux in a passive consumption plus an additional 512 every time it applies damage.
The coil is disabled unless supplied with a redstone signal. Rightclicking it with an Engineer's Screwdriver will invert this behavior.
In addition to damage, the shocks will also apply a lingering debuff, "Stunned", preventing the entity from teleporting.
Rightclicking the coil while sneaking will toggle the coil between high- and low-power mode. to be able to do so safely the coil has to be turned off. It is in high-power mode by default. When the coil is in low-power mode it will use half the usual energy and have half the range.<np>
<&faraday_recipes>If you are wearing a full Faraday suit, a coil in low-power mode won't harm you, but still shoot lightning at you. The suit will also protect you from uninsulated wiring. Coils in high-power mode use special techniques to make their discharges more lethal and will cause the suit to melt, thereby increasing the damage done to you and additionally damaging the suit.<np>
<&tube_recipes>Fluorescent tubes glow when placed inside a strong high-frequency electric field. Such a frequency is generated by any tesla coil, so placing a tube near an active tesla coil will cause it to glow. The range is about 1.5 times the range in which you will be hit by lightning. They can be colored in the engineer's workbench and rotated by shift + rightclicking them with an Engineer's Hammer.
