Basic Wiring
Bzzzt!
Power grids have three important devices: §lconnectors§r as inputs and outputs for the net, §lrelays§r attach multiple wires together, and <link;transformers;Transformers> that convert between different voltages of wire.<br>
To connect two devices, simply use a wire coil on the first device, then use the same coil on the second device. The total transfer rate between two points depends on the weakest type of wire between them.
<&images>Connectors and relays can only take wires of the same voltage that the device was designed for. Transformers will only take two wires of different voltages, and voltages only work with devices designed for them.<np>
Connectors have a maximum power they will transmit in IF/t (§o<config;iA;machines.wireConnectorInput>§r), and wires have a maximum power before they fail (§o<config;iA;wires.wireTransferRate;l3>§r) IF/t.<br>
Multiple connectors can §ounify§r onto a single wire using relays, centralizing long-range transfer to just a single wire. If enough connectors are unified that the §omaximum transfer rate§r exceeds that of the wire, §othe wire will burn up§r.<np>
Only the input and output of a wire need be working for the wire to transfer energy.<br>
Low and medium voltage wires can be insulated to prevent damage to nearby creatures.<br>
Sneaking when using the "Pick Block" function on a connector will pick the connected wire from your inventory.<br>
Wire connections will break if a block obstructs the wire.<np>
<&connector_recipes>§lConnectors§r serve as in- and outputs to the electrical grid. Powered devices connected with them will transfer power through the grid.<br>
Relays will not in- or output power, they serve as hubs for the electrical grid.
