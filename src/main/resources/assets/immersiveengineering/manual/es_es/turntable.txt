Turntable
I can't keep up
<&recipe>The Turntable will rotate blocks placed against it.
Holding an Engineer's Hammer while looking at a side of the machine displays its rotating side and the turn direction associated with the targeted side.
The turn direction is set individually for each of the 4 sides around the turning axis, allowing for ±90° or 180° turns, depending on which side receives the redstone signal.

Rightclicking with the Hammer will reorient it, sneaking while doing so will cycle through the Turntable's turn directions.
