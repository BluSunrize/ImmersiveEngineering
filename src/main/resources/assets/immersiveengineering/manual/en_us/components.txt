Crafting Components
Integral Pieces
<&mech_components>Many machines and tools are constructed from various sub-components. Some of these you will have to use on a regular basis, which is why they have their own entry in this manual. The §2Iron§r and §2Steel Mechanical Components§r are integral to the majority of Multiblocks and machinery.<np>
<&create_bp>As you will find yourself creating these components more frequently, it may be advisable to draft a <link;blueprints;Blueprint> for them. Using this blueprint in an <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench> will allow you to construct the components at a reduced cost.
The workbench recipes are found on the following page.<np>
<&tubes>Another, albeit less frequently used component are §2Vacuum Tubes§r. These glass tubes are used as elements in electronic machinery and used in <link;lighting;light emitting devices>.<np>
<&pcb>A rarely used, but crucial component in advanced machinery that requires precise calculation is the §2Circuit Board§r. They are impractically large and clunky, but can perform basic mathematic operations in under a second!
