Engineer's Skyhook
Booker, catch!
The Engineer's Skyhook is a motorized grabber system designed to hook onto wires, hemp ropes or steel cables.<br>
With it, engineers can quickly traverse the length of a powerline to move between substations or other sites.<np>
Simply hold the right mouse button while close to a wire and you will be attached to it.<br>
The button can be released while riding the wire, but letting go of the skyhook or sneaking will cause you to dismount.<br>
Gravity will be sufficient to move along decending wires at a decent speed, the standard movement keys can be used to move along ascending wires.<br>
When the skyhook reaches an intersection it will continue in as close to the direction the player is looking as possible.<np>
<&skyhook_slope>By installing a §2High Toque Motor§r, the Skyhook has a much easier time climbing up ascending wires, reducing the impact the slope has on its speed.<np>
<&skyhook_insulation>Riding along live wires can be very dangerous to the engineer's health. The §2Insulated Grip§r eliminates that risk, preventing any electric shocks from riding the Skyhook along a powerline.<np>
<&skyhook_mace>Forged from Netherite, the §2Heavy Impact Hooks§r grant the ability to do greatly increased damage when attacking while falling towards an enemy. Additionally, when performing a successful attack on an enemy this way, the wielder takes no damage from hitting the ground.
