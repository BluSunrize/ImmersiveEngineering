Jerrycan
Better than buckets
<&recipe>Jerrycans are simple metal containers used to carry fluids. They can store up to 10 buckets and can pour that fluid into the world as well as into machines.<br>
Jerrycans cannot be used to pick up fluids from the world, but can be refilled from tanks such as <link;storage_barrels;barrels> or <link;tank;large tanks>.<br>
Additionally, they can be used to refill fluid-consuming items like the <link;mining_drill;Mining Drill;start> by placing the jerrycan and the tool together in a crafting grid.
