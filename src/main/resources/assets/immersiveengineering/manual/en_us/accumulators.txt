Accumulators
Power 2 Go
<&recipes>§lAccumulators§r serve as energy storage units. Input and output power is limited to one connector of the voltage of the accumulator per side.

Side configuration can be adjusted with the hammer: Blue corresponds to input, orange corresponds to output, and no colour marking preventing any connection at all.

Sneaking while configuring a side will configure the side opposite to the one that was clicked.
