This journal shall serve as your guide for setting up all the new machines and functions this mod has to offer.<br>Let's start with the basics first: Immersive Engineering is built around the concept of retrofuturistic generation and transfer of energy. The energy used in this mod is Redstone Flux, a trait shared with many other mods currently available.
ie.manual.entry.introduction1=Energy is transmitted between §lconnectors§r by the use of §lwires§r. Wires can only bridge a limited distance of blocks, so you will need to use more connectors as §lrelays§r between the wires.<br>You have the choice between three different types of wire, which differ in transferrates, <config;iA;wireTransferRate;l3> Flux/tick. To switch between different types of wire, you will need to use §ltransformers§r.

Using this blueprint in an <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r> will allow you to construct the components at a reduced cost.<br>The workbench recipes are found on the following page.
ie.manual.entry.components2=Another, albeit less frequently used component are §6Vacuum Tubes§r. These glass tubes are used as elements in electronic machinery and used in <link;lighting;§o§nlight emitting devices§r>.
ie.manual.entry.components3=A rarely used, but crucial component in advanced machinery that requires precise calculation is the §6Circuit Board§r. They are impractically large and clunky, but can perform basic mathematic operations in under a second!

ie.manual.entry.hemp.name=Industrial Hemp
ie.manual.entry.hemp.subtext=530 fabric it
ie.manual.entry.hemp0=Industrial Hemp is a remarkable plant! Not only are its seeds useful for the the creation of <link;refinery;§o§nBiodiesel§r>, the hemp fibers are also useful for the creation of Tough Fabric. The seeds can be gathered by breaking tall grass.
ie.manual.entry.hemp1=Tough Fabric is a resilient weave made from hemp fiber. It's used to create <link;generator;§o§nImproved §o§nWindmills§r;3> as well as <link;balloon;§o§nBalloons§r> and §o§nJump §o§nCushions§r (detailed on the next page).
ie.manual.entry.hemp2=Jump Cushions are simple blocks created from tough fabric and inflated with air. They are capable of absorbing impacts and prevent falldamage when landed upon, but, unlike slime blocks, will not bounce you back up.
ie.manual.entry.hemp3=Strip Curtains are pieces of fabric that are mounted to doorframes or other openings to serve in blocking the view.<br>When an entity passes through them, they will emit a redstone signal. Rightclick them with the hammer to enable strong signals.<br>They can be dyed in the same way leather armor can.

ie.manual.entry.cokeoven.name=Coke Oven
ie.manual.entry.cokeoven.subtext=Hot topic!
ie.manual.entry.cokeoven0=The Coke Oven is the first important machine you will need to create in order to proceed with Immersive Engineering. Its functionality is simple, it will heat up coal or blocks of coal without supplying it with oxygen, creating Coal Coke, a carbon rich fuel. More importantly, this process creates §lCreosote Oil§r, which is used as a <link;treated_wood;§o§npreservative §o§nfor §o§nwood§r>. Similarly you can also burn wooden logs into charcoal with this oven, albeit with a smaller yield of creosote.
ie.manual.entry.cokeovenBlock=To form a Coke Oven, arrange 27 of these blocks in a 3x3x3 cube, and rightclick one of the sides' center blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.<br>See the following page for a diagram.

ie.manual.entry.alloysmelter.name=Alloy Kiln
ie.manual.entry.alloysmelter.subtext=Mixin' Metals
ie.manual.entry.alloysmelter0=The Alloy Kiln is a simple furnace made out of heat resistant sandstone and bricks. Within it, temperatures are high enough to allow metals to be melted into a fluid state and mixed, creating an <link;alloys;§o§nalloy§r>.<br>This allows the creation of important alloys like Electrum and Constantan without requiring the tedious mixing of dusts.
ie.manual.entry.alloysmelter1=To form the Kiln, arrange 8 of the Kiln Bricks in a 2x2x2 cube, as shown above, and rightclick one of the sides' blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.treatedwood.name=Treated Wood
ie.manual.entry.treatedwood.subtext=Highly Durable
ie.manual.entry.treatedwood0=Treated Wood is, quite simply, wooden planks covered in creosote oil. It is however, one of the most important materials you will be using in Immersive Engineering, so you'd better be prepared to create a lot of it.
ie.manual.entry.treatedwoodPost0=Posts made from treated wood make for excellent attachment points for your Wire Connectors. They are 4 blocks high, so you won't be able to place them without the proper clearance.<br>Using the hammer on the sides of the topmost block will attach an arm to the post.
ie.manual.entry.treatedwoodPost1=You can also place <link;wiring;§o§ntransformers§r;8> on the pole, which makes it less obtrusive.<br>Placing blocks below the arms of the wooden post will flip the arms upside down.

ie.manual.entry.concrete.name=Concrete
ie.manual.entry.concrete.subtext=Fortress Material
ie.manual.entry.concrete0=Concrete is a very hard and resistant composite material. It's cheap to craft and makes for an excellent use for the excess slag produced by the <link;blastfurnace;§n§oBlast §n§oFurnace§r>.

ie.manual.entry.balloon.name=Balloon
ie.manual.entry.balloon.subtext=...just make 99 of them
ie.manual.entry.balloon0=Balloons are sacks of fabric with a heatsource below to keep them afloat. They will also emit light, but despite the torch, they are not a fire hazard.<br>Balloons can be placed like normal blocks, or, when no block is targeted, they will be placed in the air infront of you.
ie.manual.entry.balloon1=Similar to <link;metalconstruction;§o§nStructural §o§nConnectors§r;5>, you can attach Hemp Rope and Steel Wire to the balloon.<br>Sneak-clicking allows you to set a height offset for the balloon, allowing you to place it up to 5 blocks above the target.<br>You can also use dyes on a placed balloon; which part you dye depends on where you target it.<br>Rightclicking with an Engineer's Hammer will toggle the balloon's design between horizontal or vertical stripes.

ie.manual.entry.crate.name=Wooden Storage Crate
ie.manual.entry.crate.subtext=Move that gear up!
ie.manual.entry.crate0=Wooden storage crates are blocks quite similar to a chest. Crafted with treated wood, they offer 27 slots of storage, however, when broken, they will keep that storage, allowing you to move them together with their contents.<br>Like chests, they will output a comparator signal based on the amount of items stored.
ie.manual.entry.crate1=The reinforced storage crate offers the same capacity as a normal crate, but unlike them, these creates are impervious to explosions. No longer will pesky creepers or ill-placed mining charges destroy your valueables!<br>The upgrade recipe will keep the contents of the crate.

ie.manual.entry.barrel.name=Wooden Barrel
ie.manual.entry.barrel.subtext=Doesn't roll
ie.manual.entry.barrel0=Wooden barrels are simple containers that can store fluid. They will store up to 12 buckets, but because they are wooden, they can't store any gasses or hot fluids.<br>Rightclicking the top or bottom side of the barrel with a Hammer will switch between in-, output or no connection.

ie.manual.entry.jerrycan.name=Jerrycan
ie.manual.entry.jerrycan.subtext=Better than buckets
ie.manual.entry.jerrycan0=Jerrycans are simple metal containers used to carry fluids. They can store up to 10 buckets and can pour that fluid into the world as well as into machines. They can not pick up fluids. Additionally, they can be used to refill other fluid-consuming items like the <link;drill;§o§nMining §o§nDrill§r> by crafting them together.

ie.manual.entry.earmuffs.name=Ear Defenders
ie.manual.entry.earmuffs.subtext=LOUD NOISES!
ie.manual.entry.earmuffs0=Ear Defenders are devices for protecting your hearing. They are quite important for engineers that work in close proximity to <link;dieselgen;§o§nDiesel §o§nGenerators§r;> or other loud machinery.<br>While wearing Ear Defenders, all noises are reduced by 90%%.
ie.manual.entry.earmuffs1=Placing the Ear Defenders in the <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r;> allows you to specify which types of noises you want cancelled and by how much their volume should be reduced.<br>You can dye them like you would leather armor.<br>Crafting them with any other helmet will attach the defenders to that piece of equipment, crafting the helmet alone will remove the defenders again, to allow further customizing.

ie.manual.entry.shield.name=Heavy Plated Shield
ie.manual.entry.shield.subtext=One Man Phalanx
ie.manual.entry.shield0=The Heavy Plated Shield is a direct upgrade to the normal wooden shields you might be acquainted with. In similar fashion, this shield will block most incoming damage from the front, but its durability has been increased considerably, and it sports the ability to be upgraded.
ie.manual.entry.shield1=The §6Flashbulb§r upgrade adds a bright lightbulb and reflector screen to the shield. Upon being attacked, the device will produce a bright, blinding flash, disorienting everyone in front of the user.
ie.manual.entry.shield2=Adding §6Shock Emitters§r to the shield allows you to retaliate against attacking enemies. When the shield is struck, it will emit a shock, inflicting minor damage to the aggressor. Additionally, it will vapourize projectiles rather than just stopping them.
ie.manual.entry.shield3=The §6Magnetic Glove§r serves as an easy way to access the shield when threatened. With this upgrade equipped, simply double-tapping the §l<keybind;key.immersiveengineering.magnetEquip>§r Key will have you retrieve the shield from your inventory and place it in your offhand slot.

ie.manual.entry.toolbox.name=Engineer's Toolbox
ie.manual.entry.toolbox.subtext=The Engineer's Handbag
ie.manual.entry.toolbox0=The toolbox is a simple, carried container, used to store all the essentials of an engineer! Hovering over the relevant slots tells you what they will accept.<br>'Food' and 'Anything' are quite self-explanatory, 'Wiring' slots are for coils, connectors and similar items, and 'Tools' will store any IE tool as well as picks, shovels and axes!
ie.manual.entry.toolbox1=Sneaking and right-clicking allows the toolbox to be placed as a block. While placed, it's inventory can still be accessed with a rightclick. Sneaking and right-clicking again will pick the toolbox up.

ie.manual.entry.graphite.name=Graphite
ie.manual.entry.graphite.subtext=Coal stuff
ie.manual.entry.graphite0=Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOP) is a complex, highly compressed, carbon material used in special engineering constructs.<br>HOP Graphite Dust is created by compressing eight pieces of Coke Dust in the <link;squeezer;§o§nIndustrial §o§nSqueezer§r>. That dust can then be smelted into an ingot.
ie.manual.entry.graphite1=The most common use for HOP Graphite is the creation of electrodes to be used in the <link;arcfurnace;§o§nArc §o§nFurnace§r>. These electrodes are created with an <link;blueprints;§o§nEngineer's §o§nBlueprint§r>, which you can<config;b;arcfurnace_electrodeCrafting; craft,> find in certain chests or trade with a villager. You can also create electrodes in the metal press, using the rod mold on 4 ingots, but the electrodes crafted this way have less durability.

ie.manual.entry.wiring.name=Basic Wiring
ie.manual.entry.wiring.subtext=Bzzzt!
ie.manual.entry.wiring0=The energy-net of Immersive Engineering has four important blocks: §lCapacitors§r to store energy, §lconnectors§r as inputs and outputs for the net, §lrelays§r to connect wires together and §ltransformers§r to switch between different levels of wire.
ie.manual.entry.wiring1=To connect two blocks, simply click the first one with a wire coil, then use the same coil on the second block. The total transfer rate between two points depends on the weakest type of wire between them.
ie.manual.entry.wiring2=Note that restrictions apply based on blocks: Connectors and relays will only take wires of the same type that is already connected, transformers will only take two wires of a different type,<br>[cont]
ie.manual.entry.wiring3=and wires can only connect to blocks that match the voltage.
ie.manual.entry.wiring4=There are two important values to note about wiring:<br>Each connector has an input value (§o<config;iA;wireConnectorInput>§r) and each wire has a maximum transfer rate (§o<config;iA;wireTransferRate;l3>§r).<br>The connector limits how much power can be in- and output, but multiple connectors can §ounify§r into a single wire, allowing you to combine the transfer over longer ranges. Note however that the §omaximum transfer rate of the wire must not be exceeded, or else the wire will §oburn up§r.
ie.manual.entry.wiring5=Wires will transfer energy even through §ounloaded chunks§r as long as the input and output chunks are loaded.<br>Uninsulated wires connected to an energy source will cause damage to players and mobs too close to them. Insulated wires are available for low and medium voltage.<br>Sneaking when using the "Pick Block" function on a connector will pick the connected wire from your inventory.<br>Wire connections will break if a block obstructing the wire is placed.
ie.manual.entry.wiringConnector=§lConnectors§r serve as in- and outputs to the IE Energy-Net. You can place them on capacitors or other Flux handlers and they will transfer power through connected wires. §lRelays§r will still accept wires but can't in- or output, they serve as connection points between wires.
ie.manual.entry.wiringCapacitor=§lCapacitors§r serve as energy storage units. You can use the hammer to adjust the configuration of each side, with blue designating an input, orange an output and no colour marking preventing any connection at all. Sneak while using the hammer to configure the side opposite of the one you clicked.
ie.manual.entry.wiringTransformer0=§lTransformers§r allow you to transition between different types of wire. The weakest wire restricts the transfer rate. Note that HV Transformers can step down to LV or MV, so you do not need to chain two transformers.
ie.manual.entry.wiringTransformer1=You can attach <link;wiring;§o§ntransformers §o§nto §o§nwooden §o§npoles§r;3> as shown on the second image on page 4, however only non-HV Transformers can be placed like this.
ie.manual.entry.wiringCutters=The §lWire Cutters§r are used to removed all the wires connected to a block by simply rightclicking it.
ie.manual.entry.wiringVoltmeter=The §lVoltmeter§r is used to measure connections. Aiming it at any energy storage or rightclicking it will read its current storage. Sneak+rightclick two connectors to calculate the average loss between them.
ie.manual.entry.wiringFeedthrough=Feedthrough Insulators allow connecting wiring from one side of a wall to wiring on the other side without a hole. They can be created with any "normal" solid block in the middle. All common types of connectors (power and redstone) can be used to create feedthrough insulators for the corresponding wire type.

ie.manual.entry.generator.name=Power Generation
ie.manual.entry.generator.subtext=
ie.manual.entry.generator0=Transferring power is quite helpful provided you have power. To actually generate Flux, you can use the kinetic forces of windmills and waterwheels. Connecting these to a dynamo will generate power based on how fast they turn.
ie.manual.entry.generator1=The Water Wheel is a fairly easy way of powering a dynamo. It's turning speed is based on the water flowing around it, so for optimal results, you'll want to direct the water in a semi-circle from the top down one side and along the bottom. Up to three water wheels can be placed against each other.
ie.manual.entry.generator2=The Windmill is a free and easy way of generating power, albeit not a very powerful one. Its speed depends the space in front of it, with its kinetic output reducing greatly if the airflow is obscured. Additionally, weather conditions like rain or thunderstorms result in stronger winds and increased rotation speeds.
ie.manual.entry.generator3=Your wind-based power generation can be improved by covering the blades of your windmill in cloth. Doing so increases the surface area and with it the rotation speed and energy output.<br>The required sails are crafted from <link;hemp;§o§ntough §o§nhemp §o§nfabric§r;1> and applied to the windmill by rightclicking it in world.

ie.manual.entry.breaker.name=Breaker Switch
ie.manual.entry.breaker.subtext=Clap on - Clap off
ie.manual.entry.breaker0=Breaker Switches are simply switches that can stop the flow of power through wires. They can connect two wires of the same type and will only allow power to pass when activated. This can be used to separate power-hungry machinery from the network or hook up an additional set of generators when needed!
ie.manual.entry.breaker1=Due to the high risk, these switches will not accept HV wires.<br>They will also emit a redstone signal when they are switched on; this behaviour can be inverted by clicking the switch with an Engineer's Hammer.<br>Additionally they are an excellent way to control your <link;lighting;powered lights;1>!
ie.manual.entry.breaker2=The Redstone Breaker is similar to a normal breaker switch, but cannot be operated manually. Instead, it will require a redstone signal to break the connection. In return, this device is insulated well enough to allow the connection of HV wires as well!

ie.manual.entry.eMeter.name=Current Transformer
ie.manual.entry.eMeter.subtext=88 Flux per hour!
ie.manual.entry.eMeter0=The Current Transformer is a measurement device for electrical power. It can be hooked up in any powerline and will keep track of energy transferred through it, returning an average Flux/t upon rightclick.

ie.manual.entry.redstoneWires.name=Redstone Wires
ie.manual.entry.redstoneWires.subtext=Integration Takeover
ie.manual.entry.redstoneWires0=§6Redstone Wires§r are aluminium coated in redstone dust. The resulting cables provide an easy way to transfer redstone signals over long distance without losing any signal strength.
ie.manual.entry.redstoneWires1=The §6connectors§r work like any other wire connector in terms of connecting them, however, redstone wiring does not require relays; connectors and relays are the same block.<br>Using the Engineer's Hammer, the connectors can be switched between in- and output mode (rightclick) and configured between 16 coloured frequencies (sneak-rightclick).
ie.manual.entry.redstoneWires2=§6Redstone Probe Connectors§r have a functionality partially comparable to Redstone Comparators. While they are not able to actively compare signals, they are able to read inventories for how full they are.
ie.manual.entry.redstoneWires3=Additionally, these probes can operate on two channels, sending their read signal on one, and still receiving signals on another. These channels can be changed by using the Engineer's Hammer.<br><br>Note that many of IE's multiblocks feature comparator-functionality, as described on the following pages. Where available, the redstone control surface of the multiblock is the designated spot to connect a comparator.
ie.manual.entry.redstoneWires4=§lTank: §rAs detailed in its <link;tank;§o§nmanual §o§nentry§r;1><br>§lSilo: §rAs detailed in its <link;silo;§o§nmanual §o§nentry§r;2><br>§lAssembler: §rOutputs a signal relative to the fill of the inventory.<br>§lAutoWorkbench: §rOutputs a signal relative to the fill of the inventory.<br>§lSqueezer: §rOutputs a signal relative to the fill of the inventory.<br>§lFermenter: §rOutputs a signal relative to the fill of the inventory.
ie.manual.entry.redstoneWires5=§lExcavator: §rOutputs a signal relative to the remaining ore in the vein.<br>§lArcFurnace: §rOutputs a signal relative to the fill of the inventory.<br>Additionally, connecting a comparator to the electrodes at the top will send a signal based on their integrity.<br>§lMixer: §rOutputs a signal relative to the fill of the inventory.<br>

ie.manual.entry.thermoElectric.name=Thermoelectric Generator
ie.manual.entry.thermoElectric.subtext=Hot and Cold
ie.manual.entry.thermoElectric0=Thermoelectric Generators are another option of power generation and work without the use of any mechanical parts, instead they use the temperature gradients between two sources.
ie.manual.entry.thermoElectric1=Placing a hot fluid on one side and a colder fluid on the opposing side generates energy based on the difference between the two temperatures.<br>The list on the following page contains other, non-fluid blocks, which can be used as sources of temperature.

ie.manual.entry.blastfurnace.name=Crude Blast Furnace
ie.manual.entry.blastfurnace.subtext=Simple Steel
ie.manual.entry.blastfurnace0=The Crude Blast Furnace is used to increase the carbon contents in iron, turning it into steel. To achieve this, only pure, high-carbon fuels may be used for the furnace, specifically coal coke and charcoal.<br><br>Along with steel, the furnace will also create slag, which you must remove or the furnace will cease to function. While technically a waste product, you can use slag to create concrete.
ie.manual.entry.blastfurnaceBlock=To form a Blast Furnace, arrange 27 of these blocks in a 3x3x3 cube, and rightclick one of the sides' center blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.<br>See the following page for a diagram.
ie.manual.entry.blastfurnace1=The Crude Blast Furnace is not automateable. All in- and outputs must be arranged manually through its GUI. If you want to automate the creation of steel, you should probably look into creating an <link;improvedBlastfurnace;§o§nImproved §o§nBlast §o§nFurnace§r;>.

ie.manual.entry.improvedBlastfurnace.name=Improved Blast Furnace
ie.manual.entry.improvedBlastfurnace.subtext=Industrialized Refinement
ie.manual.entry.improvedBlastfurnace0=The Improved Blast Furnace is a much more professional way of <link;blastfurnace;§o§ncreating §o§nsteel§r;>. Not only does it allow the automation of in- and outputs, it can also be outfitted with preheaters to speed up the refinement process by addition of hot air.<br>The furnace is made from reinforced bricks, so you'd be advised to spend your first batches of steel on this upgrade.
ie.manual.entry.improvedBlastfurnace1=The structure of the Furnace is similar to its crude predecessor, but the bricks have been reinforced and a hopper was added at the top to funnel in the inputs.
ie.manual.entry.improvedBlastfurnace2=Steel is output at the front of the furnace, slag at the back, and the furnace will automatically output to connected inventories or conveyor belts. Iron and Coal Coke are fed in through the top.
ie.manual.entry.improvedBlastfurnace3=Blast Furnace Preheaters are used to heat up air and then blow it into the furnace to speed up the refinement process of iron. Each furnace can have up to two preheaters connected to the ports on the each side, and each preheater requires <config;i;preheater_consumption> Flux/t to operate.

ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction.name=Metal Constructions
ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction.subtext=Riveting
ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction0=Apart from Treated Wood, processed metals make for common construction blocks. You can craft almost any metal into blocks and slabs, or hammer iron ingots into a sheetmetal block.
ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction1=Steel is not only an integral part of high-voltage architectures, it is also quite useful in, well, architecture. Steel scaffolding can be used to quickly create climbable structures, steel fencing keeps baddies at bay and structural arms make for great attachment points for your HV relays.
ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction2=Structural Connectors work similarly to normal connectors, but instead of transferring energy, they are purely decorative.<br>They won't accept normal wires, but Hemp Rope and Steel Cable (see next page).<br>You can also rotate them by rightclicking them with an Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.metalconstruction3=Metal ladders are...well, ladders made from metal. You can climb them, and they look cool.<br>You can also combine them with Scaffolding to make them into Covered Ladders.

ie.manual.entry.lighting.name=Engineered Lighting
ie.manual.entry.lighting.subtext=Lighting up the Wasteland
ie.manual.entry.lighting0=Deep in the halls of the factories, it can be quite dark. In order to still find your way around the machines, you should probably light up the place with some Lanterns. These Lanterns provide almost as much light as a glowstone block would.
ie.manual.entry.lighting1=Powered Lanterns are one of the first ever invented uses for electric power. To run these, you need to connect them directly to your power grid using wires. They will allow power to be transferred through them, so you can link them in a row.<br>Using the Engineer's Hammer on them will flip them upside down.
ie.manual.entry.lighting2=As long as they are supplied with a little bit of power, they will light up the surrounding area like a normal Lantern, but additionally, they will also prevent hostile mobs to spawn in a 32 block radius!
ie.manual.entry.lighting3=Floodlights are strong lightsources. While they require more power than a simple Powered Lantern, they will create a cone of light up to 32 blocks long. Use an Engineer's Hammer on the top or bottom faces of the block to rotate the light or click its sides to change its pitch.
ie.manual.entry.lighting4=Generally, Floodlights require a redstone signal to run, however their control-behavior can be inverted by sneaking and right-clicking their base with an Engineer's Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.metalPress.name=Metal Press
ie.manual.entry.metalPress.subtext=Under Pressure!
ie.manual.entry.metalPress0=The Metal Press is an automated way of shaping metal. It uses a high pressure piston to press a mold onto an ingot, forming it into a plate, rod or other metal components.<br>The structure is created as shown above, to form the multiblock, click the piston with an Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.metalPress1=Power is input through the top, and items through the conveyors, obviously in the direction of movement. The lower middle block is the redstone control port, rightclicking it with an Engineer's Hammer allows you to invert the redstone control.
ie.manual.entry.metalPress2=To actually work, the metal press requires a mold to be attached to the piston. These molds are created in the <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r> using the blueprint displayed above.
ie.manual.entry.metalPress3=Molds are crafted as shown above, with the wirecutter taking some damage for every crafting operation. They are then inserted into the metal press by right-clicking the multiblock with a mold in hand.
ie.manual.entry.metalPress4=The packing and unpacking molds can be used to compress 4 or 9 of the same item into their relevant storage form, as well as unpack them again. This can be utilized to store ingots as blocks, or automatically create simple blocks like Sandstone.

ie.manual.entry.tank.name=Tank
ie.manual.entry.tank.subtext=Full to the brim!
ie.manual.entry.tank0=The Tank is a multiblock that provides space for large amounts of fluid. It will store up to 512 buckets of any fluid, which can be piped in through the top or bottom block. Fluids can only be extracted from the bottom center block.
ie.manual.entry.tank1=Applying a redstone signal to the bottom center block will make the tank output automatically, a comparator placed there will emit a redstone signal proportional to how full the tank is. Attaching the comparator to one of the top 4 layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator. For example, a comparator attached to the second layer of a tank would not emit any signal until the tank is 1/4 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the tank is half full or more.

ie.manual.entry.silo.name=Silo
ie.manual.entry.silo.subtext=Full to the brim!
ie.manual.entry.silo0=Silos offer space for a lot of items of the same type, making them excellent for mass storage of seeds, slag or cobblestone. They have space for 41472 items, equaling the capacity of 24 chests.
ie.manual.entry.silo1=Items must be input through the top and extracted from the bottom. Applying a redstone signal to the bottom block will make it output automatically.
ie.manual.entry.silo2=A comparator attached to the bottom center block will it emit a redstone signal proportional to how full the silo is. Attaching the comparator to one of the top 6 layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator. For example, a comparator attached to the third layer of a silo would not emit any signal until the tank is 2/6 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the silo is half full or more.

ie.manual.entry.metalbarrel.name=Metal Barrel
ie.manual.entry.metalbarrel.subtext=Doesn't roll
ie.manual.entry.metalbarrel0=Metal barrels work exactly like <link;barrel;§o§nWooden §o§nBarrels§r;>. They store the same amount of fluid and their in- and outputs are configured the same way, but unlike the wooden version, these can store gasses and hot fluids, and won't output automatically if receiving a redstone signal

ie.manual.entry.assembler.name=Assembler
ie.manual.entry.assembler.subtext=Some assembly required
ie.manual.entry.assembler0=The Assembler is a complex machine capable of crafting items, similar to how a player would.<br>To form the structure, build it like demonstrated above and use the hammer on one of the conveyors.

ie.manual.entry.autoworkbench1=Upon assembling the multiblocks, a Blueprint can be placed on its drawing table. After selecting the item that should be created, it will begin the assembly process. In order for the machine to work, it will need to be supplied with materials and power of course.<br>Item inputs are the two hatches marked with blue dots, the power input lies above them. Finished items are dropped at the end of the conveyor belt.<br>A redstone signal below the drawing table can be used for control.

ie.manual.entry.bottlingMachine.name=Bottling Machine
ie.manual.entry.bottlingMachine.subtext=Fill 'er up!
ie.manual.entry.bottlingMachine0=The Bottling Machine fills fluids into containers.<br>The structure is created as shown above, but can be mirrored. To form it, rightclick the central coveyor with an Engineer's Hammer. The direction of the conveyors is important.
ie.manual.entry.bottlingMachine1=Fluid is input through the ports on the lower block of the metal tank. Energy is input through the port at the top of the opposing side.<br>Generally, the Bottling Machine will be able to fill any container that has a filled version available (bucket, glass bottle).

ie.manual.entry.belljar.name=Garden Cloche
ie.manual.entry.belljar.subtext=Localized Rainforest
ie.manual.entry.belljar0=The Garden Cloche, or Belljar, is a device designed to hasten the growth of plants. It allows even the an agriculturally challenged engineer to grow plants and harvest their yield.
ie.manual.entry.belljar1=The device accepts power, fluid and items through its respective ports. Water and power are always required, various fertilizers are optional. The GUI features slots for soil and seed in the middle, fertilizer on the left and outputs on the right.<br>The hatch on the front of the glass dome is the only automatic output. Every seed needs to be paired with the correct soil to grow on, with dirt being automatically recognized as farmland.

ie.manual.entry.highvoltage.name=High-Voltage
ie.manual.entry.highvoltage.subtext=You can't shake the shock
ie.manual.entry.highvoltage0=High-Voltage wires have the highest available transfer rate (<config;iA;wireTransferRate;2> Flux/t) and will need special connectors. Note that on High voltage connections, §oConnectors and Relays are different blocks§r, Relays will not be able to in- or output to the energy net. Furthermore, §oRelays can only be placed on the underside of the block.§r<br>To transition from HV to LV or MV connections, you will need High-Voltage Transformers, and keep in mind, the lowest tier of wire limits the transferrate of an entire connection.

ie.manual.entry.multiblocks.name=Multiblock Constructions
ie.manual.entry.multiblocks.subtext=Where's my Allen Wrench?
ie.manual.entry.multiblocks0=Fitting complex machinery into a single 1x1x1 cube seems to be a task unmanageable without the use of magic or possibly shrink rays. So in order to create more complex machines, you will need component blocks. The most common ones have been listed on the following pages.

ie.manual.entry.workbench.name=Engineer's Workbench
ie.manual.entry.workbench.subtext=Overclocking
ie.manual.entry.workbench0=Over the course of your Engineering career you may come to deal with some tools that can be optimized and modified. To apply these modifications, you should use a properly equipped Engineer's Workbench.<br>Rightclick the Workbench, insert the item into the slot and insert applicable upgrades into the new slots that appear.

ie.manual.entry.blueprints.name=Engineer's Blueprints
ie.manual.entry.blueprints.subtext=RTFM
ie.manual.entry.blueprints0=There are certain items which are very complex in their construction and require more than just a simple block of wood with a grid on it. These items will need to be created under the instructions of precise Blueprints on an <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r>.<br><br>Should you come across an Engineer's Blueprint (or maybe even create one yourself), you can place it in the slot of the Engineer's Workbench.
ie.manual.entry.blueprints1=To create the items detailed in the Blueprint, you insert the required materials into the 6 slots in the middle, and retrieve the assembled results from the output slots to the right. Hovering your mouse over these output slots will inform you exactly which materials are needed for each item.

ie.manual.entry.mixer.name=Mixer
ie.manual.entry.mixer.subtext=Vats of Cookie Dough!
ie.manual.entry.mixer0=The Mixer is a multiblock structure that dissolves solids in fluids, mixing them together. The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central sheetmetal block.
ie.manual.entry.mixer1=The most common uses for this machine are the mixing of fluid concrete from water, 2 parts sand 1 part gravel and 1 part clay, or the creation of potions from water and their various ingredients.
ie.manual.entry.mixer2=Fluids are input into the mixer through the port at the bottom of its powersupply. Items can be input via the two hatches at the back. The fluid port at the front serves as the fluid output.<br>Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.squeezer.name=Squeezer
ie.manual.entry.squeezer.subtext=Pressing matters
ie.manual.entry.squeezer0=The Squeezer is a multiblock structure that presses juice or oil out of organic materials by use of a big piston. The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central wooden barrel, from the side that has the Engineering Blocks.
ie.manual.entry.squeezer1=Items can be input into the Squeezer via the two hatches at the back that are marked with blue dots. The hatch with the orange dot serves as an item output and the block below it to output fluids.<br>Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.squeezer2T=The following list shows various items that can be squeezed into plant oil, and the amount they produce.

ie.manual.entry.fermenter.name=Fermenter
ie.manual.entry.fermenter.subtext=Skál!
ie.manual.entry.fermenter0=The Fermenter is a multiblock structure that extracts ethanol from certain fruits, grains and vegetables through a fermenting process. The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central cauldron, from the side that has the Engineering Blocks.
ie.manual.entry.fermenter1=Items can be input into the Fermenter via the two hatches at the back that are marked with blue dots. The hatch with the orange dot serves as an item output and the block below it to output fluids.<br>Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.fermenter2T=The following list shows various items that can be fermented into ethanol, and the amount they produce.

ie.manual.entry.refinery.name=Refinery
ie.manual.entry.refinery.subtext=Fluid mixing!
ie.manual.entry.refinery0=The Refinery is a complex multiblock that can refine one or two fluids into another. The most common application of this is the refinement of <link;squeezer;Plant Oil> and <link;fermenter;Ethanol> into Biodiesel.
ie.manual.entry.refinery1=To form the structure, rightclick the Heavy Engineering Block on the middle layer.<br>Fluids are input through the two ports on either side of the block and output through the orange marked port at the front.<br>Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.dieselgen.name=Diesel Generator
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen.subtext=Better than volume: More volume.
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen0=High-Voltage architecture might be fascinating, but it's not very useful unless you have a generator that can actually create the required output for it.<br>The Diesel Generator is one of the few ways of generating this sort of energy. It is created as a complex multiblock structure and will run off of <link;refinery;§o§nBiodiesel§r> or other types of combustible fuel. Due to its high output, it will work through fuel very quickly, so make sure you have a sufficient fuel production to run it.
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen1=The structure is built from Engineering, Generator and Radiator blocks as well as Fluid Pipes and Scaffolding. Arrange them in the shape shown above and rightclick the central generator with an Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen2=Fuel is to be input at the bottom corners of the generator, whereas energy will be output to up to three connections on the top. The <config;i;dieselGen_output>Flux/t the generator outputs will be split between all connected points.<br>The small terminal on the side will turn off the generator if supplied with a redstone signal, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.dieselgen3=The following table lists all valid fuels for the Diesel Generator and for how long in seconds (ticks) they burn.

ie.manual.entry.biodiesel.name=Biodiesel
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel.subtext=Green power!
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel0=Combustible fuels are an easy to use and efficient fuel source. But with oil being a depletable resource, something renewable would be much preferable. Biodiesel is the solution! By combining plant oil and ethanol, you can create a combustible fluid that will burn in the <link;dieselgen;§o§nDiesel §o§nGenerator§r>.
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel1=Plant Oil is created by processing various seeds in the industrial squeezer. Create the structure pictured above and click one of the sides with an Engineer's Hammer to form it. Power is input at the top or bottom, fluids are output through any of the ports at the
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel1T=bottom of each side.<br>The following list shows various items that can be squeezed into plant oil, and the amount they produce.
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel2=Ethanol is gained by fermenting sugarcane or other fruit. The fermenter's structure is created in a similar manner to that of the squeezer, as such power in- and fluid outputs are identical.
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel2T=The following list shows various items that can be fermented into ethanol, and the amount they produce.
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel3=Lastly, in order to refine plant oil and ethanol into Biodiesel, you will need to insert both fluids into a refinery and supply it with power. The structure is created as shown above and formed by clicking the center of the front with an
ie.manual.entry.biodiesel4=Engineer's Hammer.<br>The front of the refinery serves as fluid output, whereas the inputs are found on the smaller sides. Energy is supplied through the connector at the back. Applying a redstone signal to the control panel on the right will halt the refinery's process.

ie.manual.entry.conveyor.name=Conveyor Belts
ie.manual.entry.conveyor.subtext=Who needs rails anyway?
ie.manual.entry.conveyor0=Conveyor Belts are an easy way of transporting all sorts of things around your base. While they are strong enough to move living creatures like cows or sheep, their true strength lies in transporting items.<br>Throwing items atop them will have the items move along the belt. Should the belt lead into an inventory, the item will be inserted.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor1=Blocks like hoppers will be able to drop items onto the belts. Use an Engineer's Hammer to rotate the belts (rightclick) or adjust whether they should run up- or downwards (sneak + rightclick).<br>Using a redstone signal on a conveyor will turn it off, this behavior can be disabled by crafting it into a redstone-ignoring version. <br>Rightclicking a conveyor with any dye will colour the walls of the conveyor to easily identify where it is going.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor2=The Dropping Conveyor Belt is quite simply a conveyor with a hatch in the middle, allowing it to drop items that pass over it downwards.<br>Items will be inserted into inventories below or simply dropped if there is an empty space below the conveyor.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor3=The Extracting Conveyor Belt posesses the ability to extract items from an inventory in a similar fashion to a Hopper. Unlike the latter however, it posesses no internal inventory and will place extracted items on the belt.<br>Sneak + rightlick with an Engineer's Hammer to change its input side. Use a wirecutter to adjust its tickrate.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor4=The Vertical Conveyor Belt is a belt meant to be mounted on walls. Using the buckets attached to it, it will lift entities straight up. Despite the use of the term "bucket", it will not lift fluids.<br>This belt can insert into inventories above it or simply expel items over the edge at the top onto more conveyors.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor5=The Splitting Conveyor Belt alternates between redirecting Items and Entities left and right, plain and simple. This feature can be used to achieve a more equal distribution in your factories.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor6=The Covered Conveyor Belt works just like a normal conveyor, however it is covered by a piece of scaffolding, which prevents players from picking up items from it.<br>You can rightclick it with other types of scaffold or glass to change the cover's appearance.
ie.manual.entry.conveyor7=Similarly, the Extracting and Vertical Conveyors can also be covered in scaffolding to achieve the same benefits of "pickup-prevention" while still functioning as they normally do.

ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater.name=External Heater
ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater.subtext=Now you're cooking with flux!
ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater0=The External Heater does exactly what its name implies, it generates thermal energy from Flux. When placed next to a normal furnace, this thermal energy will power the furnace, allowing it to smelt without any fuel inside it.
ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater1=Click a side of the heater with a hammer to make it an energy acceptor, sneak to target the opposing side.<br>The heater will consume §o<config;i;heater_consumption> Flux/t§r for each heat unit added. During the initial phase of the furnace, the heater will produce up to §o4§r units of heat per tick, but as soon as the furnace reaches maximum temperature, it will only require §o1§r unit of heat to keep it going.
ie.manual.entry.furnaceHeater2=Even better, while the furnace is at maximum temperature, the heater will consume an additional §o<config;i;heater_speedupConsumption> Flux/t§r to increase the furnace's processing speed.<br>The heater will only affect a furnace with a valid input and space in the output slot, in order to conserve energy. However, you can apply a redstone signal to the heater to disable that functionality and have it keep the furnace at full heat.

ie.manual.entry.teslaCoil.name=Tesla Coil
ie.manual.entry.teslaCoil.subtext=This one goes up to 11
ie.manual.entry.teslaCoil0=The Tesla Coil started as a concept of wireless energy transfer. However, due to its potentially high loss rates and it's rather interesting property of frying every living being in a 6 meter radius, it was quickly converted into an Engineer's dream of home defense.
ie.manual.entry.teslaCoil1=The upkeep cost of this machine is high, clocking in at a regular <config;i;teslacoil_consumption> Flux in passive consumption plus an additional <config;i;teslacoil_consumption_active> every time it applies damage.<br>The coil is disabled unless supplied with a redstone signal. Rightclicking it with an Engineer's Hammer will invert this behaviour.<br>In addition to damage, the shocks will also apply a lingering debuff, "Stunned", preventing the entity from teleporting.
ie.manual.entry.teslaCoil2=Rightclicking the coil with an Engineer's Hammer while sneaking will toggle the coil between high- and low-power mode. To be able to do so safely the coil has to be turned off. It is in high-power mode by default. When the coil is in low-power mode it will use half the usual energy and have
ie.manual.entry.teslaCoil3=half the range. If you are wearing a full Faraday suit, a coil in low-power mode won't harm you, but still shoot lightning at you. Coils in high-power mode will cause the suit to melt, thereby increasing the damage done to you and additionally damaging the suit.<br>Fluorescent tubes glow when placed inside a strong high-frequency electric field. Such a field is generated by any tesla coil, so placing a tube near an active tesla coil will cause it to glow. The range is about 1.5 times the range in
ie.manual.entry.teslaCoil4=which you will be hit by lightning. They can be colored in the engineer's workbench and rotated by (shift) rightclicking them with an Engineer's Hammer

ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes.name=Fluid Transport
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes.subtext=Professional Plumber
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes0=Transporting fluids has become quite essential in the engineering business. Fluid Pipes and Fluid Pumps do exactly that. On their own, Fluid Pipes are quite slow at transferring fluids, but if a pump is used to insert the fluid, it'll move much faster.
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes1=You can rightclick the connection piece of a pipe with an Engineer's Hammer to prevent it from connecting to that side.<br>Fluid Pipes can be covered with wooden or steel scaffolding. Simply rightclick a piece of scaffolding onto a pipe to cover it. Break the pipe to retrieve the scaffolding.
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes2=Fluid Pumps have three essential functions. They can be used to insert into pipes at high pressure, to transfer fluids much faster, or they can pick up fluids from the world. Using your hammer on the base of the pump will switch the sides between in- and output.
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes3=In order for the pump to pick up fluid blocks, it will need a power input at the top and a redstone signal. Pumps can also be used to extract from tanks and other fluid containers that do not have an automatic output. This will also require a redstone signal, but won't consume power.
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes4=<config;b;pump_infiniteWater;Water blocks will serve as an infinite fluid source for the pump, as long as more than 3 blocks are connected.<br><br>;><config;b;pump_placeCobble;Fluid blocks that were picked up will be replaced with cobblestone to reduce the lag of flowing fluids. This behaviour can be toggled off and on by using an Engineer's Hammer on the pump.;>
ie.manual.entry.fluidPipes5=The Fluid Outlet acts as an endpoint for a pipe system, allowing Fluid to be placed in the world. The sides can be configured between input, output (open gate) or closed, a redstone signal can be used to turn the outlet off.<br>The block will only ever output fluid up to its own heightlevel.

ie.manual.entry.sorter.name=Item Router
ie.manual.entry.sorter.subtext=Left foot yellow, right hand green
ie.manual.entry.sorter0=The Item Router is a block which will accept and redistribute items down filtered paths. Place it down and rightclick it to open the interface, which shows six different, colour and direction coordinated filters.
ie.manual.entry.sorter1=When an item enters the router, it will be routed to an output whose filter matches the item, or, if no matching filter is found, it routes to an unfiltered output. If the router cannot route the item in the first place, it will not allow the item to enter the router. Items also can not be output to the side it was inserted from.<br>The buttons above each filter can be used to have the router respect or ignore OreDictionary, NBT and Metadata.

ie.manual.entry.fluidSorter.name=Fluid Router
ie.manual.entry.fluidSorter.subtext=Milk goes left, acid goes right
ie.manual.entry.fluidSorter0=The Fluid Router works much akin to the <link;sorter;§o§nItem §o§nRouter§r>. Fluids input through any side will be redistributed based on how the six side filters are set up. Clicking a bucket or any other type of fluid container into the slots of the GUI will configure the filter to that fluid.
ie.manual.entry.fluidSorter1=When any fluids are piped into the router, they will be routed to an output whose filter matches the fluid, or, if no matching filter is found, the fluid routes to an unfiltered output. If there is no available or valid route, no fluid will be accepted.<br>The buttons above each filter can be used to have the router respect or ignore the fluid's NBT data.

ie.manual.entry.turntable.name=Turntable
ie.manual.entry.turntable.subtext=I can't keep up
ie.manual.entry.turntable0=The Turntable will rotate blocks placed against it.<br>Holding an Engineer's Hammer while looking at the machine displays its active side and turn direction. Rightclicking with the Hammer will reorient it, sneaking while doing so will invert the Turntable's rotation direction.

ie.manual.entry.drill.name=Mining Drill
ie.manual.entry.drill.subtext=My drill will pierce the Bedrock!
ie.manual.entry.drill0=The handheld, diesel-powered drill is a big advancement in mining. With exchangeable drill heads and upgrades, its properties are almost entirely modifiable. To modify it, place it in an <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r>.<br>The drill runs off of <link;refinery;§o§nBiodiesel§r> and can be filled directly in the refinery.
ie.manual.entry.drill1=The §6Drill Head§r determines the base §6mining level§r, §6speed§r, and §6size§r, as well as the §6attack damage§r. As you dig blocks, the drill head takes damage, but it can be repaired in an anvil.
ie.manual.entry.drill2=As the drill is powered by a combustion engine, it will not run underwater unless you equip it with the Pressurized Air Tank Upgrade. However, with this upgrade equipped, it will not only run while submerged, but also ignore the slowdown usually experienced when digging in water.
ie.manual.entry.drill3=The §6Advanced Lubrication System§r applies additional lubricant to the drill at a regular basis, decreasing the damage done to the drillhead.
ie.manual.entry.drill4=By adding §6Additional Augers§r to the drill, its destructive potential is increased, increasing its damage against living creatures and allowing it to run and dig faster.<br>The upgrade stacks up to three times.
ie.manual.entry.drill5=The §6Large Fuel Tank§r allows the drill to store more fuel internally, extending the time you can use it before refilling.

ie.manual.entry.revolver.name=Revolver
ie.manual.entry.revolver.subtext=Wanted: Dead or Alive
ie.manual.entry.revolver0=The Revolver, a more elegant weapon from a more civilized age, is an achievement of small mechanics. Small being relative here, since this weapon is chambered for 12-gauge.<br>Similar to the Mining Drill, the Revolver will allow for modification in the <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r>, as detailed on the last pages.
ie.manual.entry.revolver1=There are different <link;bullets;§o§ntypes §o§nof §o§nammunition§r;> the Revolver will accept. To load it, sneak+rightclick the weapon, then place cartridges into the slots.<br>A loaded Speedloader in your inventory will be used to refill the revolver after you've fired your last shot.
ie.manual.entry.revolver2=By attaching a §6bayonet§r to the revolver, you outfit it with close-quarter-combat capabilities, allowing for melee damage as powerful as an Iron Sword.
ie.manual.entry.revolver3=The §6Extended Magazine§r allows loading 6 more cartridges into the revolver. This magazine does not get refilled by a speedloader.
ie.manual.entry.revolver4=The §6Amplifying Electron Tubes§r apply an electric shock to fired projectiles. This shock persists till it hits the target (don't ask how it works) and is passed on. The target will be stunned for a fraction of a second and all powered equipment they may be using will suffer a slight discharge.

ie.manual.entry.bullets.name=Revolver Cartridges
ie.manual.entry.bullets.subtext=
ie.manual.entry.bullets0=Cartridges are created in the Engineer's Workbench, by the use of specific <link;blueprints;§o§nEngineer's §o§nBlueprints§r>. Blueprints for normal ammunition you can create yourself, but some more advanced types of ammunition will require you to buy adequate blueprints from someone else.
ie.manual.entry.bullets1=§lEmpty §lCasings§r and §lShells§r are the basis for every projectile. Empty Casings can also be crafted in the <link;metalPress;§o§nMetal §o§nPress§r>, using the appropriate mold, at a greatly reduced cost.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_casull=§lCasull §lCartridges§r are created with a "Common Projectiles" blueprint. They are a simple lead projectile inflicting medium damage.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_armorPiercing=§lArmor-Piercing §lCartridges§r are created with the same blueprint. They do the same amount of damage but penetrate armor by sheer kinetic force.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_buckshot=§lBuckshot §lCartridges§r, created with the aformentioned blueprint, are filled with multiple small projectiles that are fired out in a cone shape. This cartridge is highly effective at short range.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_HE=§lHigh-Explosive §lCartridges§r are created with a "Common Projectiles" blueprint. They fire a projectile that explodes on impact, causing damage to living creatures and terrain.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_silver=§lSilver §lCartridges§r consist of a lead core wrapped in silver, making them highly effective against undead.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_dragonsbreath=§lDragon's §lBreath Cartridges§r are created with a "Specialized Projectiles" blueprint. Similarly to Buckshot, they are effective at short range, but instead of small metal shots, they are filled with a flammable metal dust, creating a blast of flame.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_potion=§lPhial §lCartridges§r are also created with the "Specialized" blueprint. They can be filled with any potion by crafting them together in a crafting grid and this potion will then be applied on impact. Normal potions require a direct hit, splash potions have an area of effect and Lingering Potions will create a temporary, lingering potion cloud.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_flare=§lFlare §lCartridges§r are created with the "Specialized" blueprint. When fired, the flare explodes after a certain distance and then slowly sinks to the ground. You can combine the cartridge with dyes in a crafting table to change its colour.
ie.manual.entry.bullets_wolfpack=§lWolfpack §lCartridges§r are a collection of multiple homing shots in a single shell. The initial projectile is unguided, but on impact, it splits into six target seeking shots that shred the enemies.

ie.manual.entry.chemthrower.name=Chemical Thrower
ie.manual.entry.chemthrower.subtext=BURN ALL THE THINGS!
ie.manual.entry.chemthrower0=The Chemical Thrower is a device that propels fluids from its internal tank. The device can be loaded with any fluid, liquid or gas, and, on right click, will spray it out.<br>It also features a function to ignite the fluid, if it is flammable. To toggle the pilot light, sneak and rightclick.
ie.manual.entry.chemthrower1=Like some other tools, the chemical thrower can be modified in the <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r>. These upgrades affect the size of the tank, range and spread.<br><br>The §6Large Tank§r increases the fluid capacity of the Chemical Thrower by 2000 mb.
ie.manual.entry.chemthrower2=The §6Focused Nozzle§r decreases the spread of fluids sprayed out and also slightly increases their range, allowing you to hit further targets with more precision.
ie.manual.entry.chemthrower3=The §6Multitank§r allows the Chemthrower to store up to three different Fluids. You can select the active tank by <config;b;chemthrower_scroll;sneaking and using the scrollwheel, or through use of;using> the keybind §l<keybind;key.immersiveengineering.chemthrowerSwitch>§r if it has been set in the options.<br>This upgrade is mutually exclusive to the §6Large Tank§r.

ie.manual.entry.skyhook0=The Engineer's Skyhook is a motorized grabber system designed to hook onto wires, hemp ropes or steel cables.<br>With it, engineers can quickly traverse the length of a powerline to move between substations or other installations.
ie.manual.entry.skyhook1=Simply hold the right mousebutton while close to a connector and you will be attached to the wire.<br>Releasing the button at any time or sneaking will cause you to dismount.<br>You cannot start in the middle of a wire, you must attach at a connector.

ie.manual.entry.shader.name=Shaders
ie.manual.entry.shader.subtext=Blue! No, yellow!
ie.manual.entry.shader0=Shaders are items you can find in the world or aquire by trading with villagers. They don't have a purpose by themselves, but they can be equipped to <link;revolver;§o§nRevolvers§r>, <link;drill;§o§nDrills§r>, <link;chemthrower;§o§nChemical §o§nThrowers§r>, <link;shield;§o§nPlated §o§nShield§r> or <link;railgun;§o§nRailguns§r>(and possibly other things you still have to discover) to change the designs of the item. Simply put the item in an <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r> and equip the shader in the appropriate slot.<br>You can also apply them to a Minecart or a <link;balloon;§o§nBalloon§r> by rightclicking!
ie.manual.entry.shader1=For a full list of all available shaders, their looks, references and more details, <link;shaderList;§o§ncheck §o§nhere§r>
ie.manual.entry.shader2=Shader Grabbags are items containing a random shader. They can be found in crates, traded from villagers or dropped by bosses. The rarity of the contained shader is equal to, or better than the rarity of the bag. When using a bag, you are more likely to get a shader you do not yet own, than one you already posess.
ie.manual.entry.shader3=Shaders bags can be crafted into two bags of a lower level. This will lower your chances of getting rarer shaders but provide you with more attempts.
//Shaders themselves can also be crafted into a single bag of the lower level.

ie.manual.entry.powerpack.name=Capacitor Backpack
ie.manual.entry.powerpack.subtext=Do....Ray....Egon!
ie.manual.entry.powerpack0=Energy storage takes space and some heavy weight components. As such, storing large amounts of energy in each tool individually is inefficient and makes them akward to wield.<br>The Capacitor Backpack acts as a compromise, offering a centralized storage of energy for any powered tools to tap into.
ie.manual.entry.powerpack1=The backpack charges any tools held in main- or offhand as well as any armorpieces you are wearing.<br>The capacitor can be worn on your back like a piece of chest armor, or you may attach it to most common sets of armor in order to gain the benefit of a power-supply as well as protection.

ie.manual.entry.railgun.name=Railgun
ie.manual.entry.railgun.subtext=Velocitas Eradico
ie.manual.entry.railgun0=The Railgun (or more accurately the Portable Induction Catapult) is a marvel of engineering. It consists of two rails through which an electric current flows and accelerates a sled, and by that, a projectile.<br>The process is energy intensive but will accelerate various projectiles to high speeds.
ie.manual.entry.railgun1=To launch a projectile from your inventory, click and hold the use button till the charge level reaches 99, then release.<br><br>Valid projectiles include, for instance, §6iron§r and §6steel rods§r<config;b;literalRailGun;, §6rebar§r and almost §6every rail§r from Railcraft;>, as well as §6graphite electrodes§r.<br><br>Due to the low internal energy storage, it is recommended to use the Railgun along with a <link;powerpack;§o§nCapacitor §o§nBackpack§r>.
ie.manual.entry.railgun2=As with other IE tools, the railgun can be modified in the <link;workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r> and be customized with <link;shader;§o§nShaders§r>.<br><br>The §6Additional Capacitors§r greatly reduce the railgun's charge time.

ie.manual.entry.turret.name=Turrets
ie.manual.entry.turret.subtext=Are you still there?
ie.manual.entry.turret0=Turrets are the next step in automated defense of your factory. They feature a complex optical system combined with mechanical "brain" to effectively distinguish and acquire targets and use the inbuilt weaponry to neutralize them.<br>All turrets feature energy ports at their base, and require a redstone signal to be active, although this behaviour can be inverted by sneaking and rightclicking it with an Engineer's Hammer.
ie.manual.entry.turret1=Upon being placed, Turrets will remember their owner and will not allow other users to break or modify them. Rightclicking the turret brings up the GUI which features a list of names with an entry field, as well as multiple targeting options.<br>By the default the list is a blacklist of targets that may not be attacked. This list utilizes creatures names, so whitelisting animals is possible.
ie.manual.entry.turret2=The Chemthrower Turret utilizes the fluid propelling capabilities of the <link;chemthrower;§o§neponymous §o§ntool§r> to cover targets in anything, ranging from water to douse flames, to diesel oil to start them.
ie.manual.entry.turret3=The turret features a fluid port in the bottom and back of the base to allow pipes to connect to it. Additionally, the GUI has a button on the left which dis- or enables the pilot flame, igniting the dispensed fluid, provided that it is flammable.<br><br>§oThe providers of this blueprint are not liable for any damage to user, neighbours or various farm animals that may incur.§r
ie.manual.entry.turret4=The Gun Turret features a heavily modified version of the <link;revolver;§o§nRevolver's§r> internals in a far bigger and more imposing casing. The construction also involves an extended magazine to allow for increased internal storage of ammunition.
ie.manual.entry.turret5=A port for the automatic insertion of ammo and extraction of spent casing is located within the back and bottom of the base. The turret can store up to a full stack of cartridges and the GUI features a button to toggle the automatic expulsion of spent casings.<br><br>§oNote that certain ammunitions may cause collateral damage to the user or their property.§r

ie.manual.entry.maneuverGear.name=3D Maneuver Gear
ie.manual.entry.maneuverGear.subtext=Attack on upscaled zombies
ie.manual.entry.maneuverGear0=The 3D Maneuver Gear is a marvel of engineering. It consists of a harness of leather straps, two grappling hooks and a pressurized air propulsion system.<br>The gear is equipped in the <config;b;baubles;Baubles belt slot or the ;>leggings slot and powered with Flux charge.
ie.manual.entry.maneuverGear1=§l§nControls:§r<br>Holding the <keybind;key.immersiveengineering.3dgear> Key will switch you to the Maneuver Gear controls. In this controlmode, the mousebuttons will fire the hooks at the cost of some Flux charge. While the hooks are embedded in an object, holding the button will pull you to that object. A doubleclick will dislodge the hook and return it to you.<br>Double-tapping the <keybind;key.immersiveengineering.3dgear> Key will return both hooks.
ie.manual.entry.maneuverGear2=§l§nPropulsion:§r<br>Pressing the jump key while the <keybind;key.immersiveengineering.3dgear> Key is held will expend some of the pressurized air to give you a quick burst of speed in the direction you are looking. After not using the propulsion system for few seconds, the internal compressor will quickly refill the tank at the cost of Flux charge.<br>Should you land from a height prone to damage you, the system will automatically expend pressurized air to cushion your fall.

ie.manual.entry.crusher.name=Crusher
ie.manual.entry.crusher.subtext=Keep your hands out!
ie.manual.entry.crusher0=Crushing an ore is an effective way of increasing their yield, for each ore creates two dusts which you can then smelt. This industrial-size crusher is a quick way of doing so. The machine's processing speed depends on the power supplied to it.
ie.manual.entry.crusher1=Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will halt the crushers process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.<br>The structure is formed by right clicking the central block of the front. The front is the wide side of the structure which has a light engineering block at the bottom.
//However, it is not only used for crushing ores. Every living being to fall into the machine will take grave damage and the crusher will output the relevant drops. Likewise, all items that cannot be processed will be destroyed.<br>

ie.manual.entry.lightningrod1=When the steel pole is struck, the huge amounts of energy created are stored in the base of the lightning rod and then slowly distributed to the energy connections at the sides.<br><br>You can improve the chances of the Lightning Rod getting struck by creating a "net" of steel fences connected to the topmost fence.

ie.manual.entry.minerals.name=Mineral Deposits
ie.manual.entry.minerals.subtext=Oresome
ie.manual.entry.minerals0=The deposits of Ore found around your world are nothing new to you. What you have so far left out of consideration though are mineral veins, which contain a mix of different ores. Due to their wide and thin spread, the average miner can't find them, but a <link;excavator;§o§nspecial §o§nmachine§r> might be able to assist with that.
ie.manual.entry.minerals1=To find and determine minerals in the world, you will want to craft a Core Sample Drill. Supply the machine with power and rightclick it or use redstone to activate it. It drills into the chunk and extracts a core sample which shows if and what mineral was found and its yield.
ie.manual.entry.minerals2=The Drill consumes <config;i;coredrill_consumption> Flux/t and takes <config;i;coredrill_time> ticks to fully retrieve and analyse a sample.<br><br>The sample can also be placed as a block by sneaking and rightclicking. Using a map on the sample block will set a marker for the chunk.<br><br>The following pages list every type of vein and the ores that can be retrieved from them.
ie.manual.entry.minerals3=%1$s<br>It consists of %2$s.
ie.manual.entry.mineralsDimValid=§l%1$s§r is a mineral vein that can be found in the %2$s.

ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace.name=Arc Furnace
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace.subtext=Not a reactor
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace0=The Arc Furnace is a massive structure used to quickly smelt metals. It consists of a steel vat topped by electrodes which heat up the metal.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace1=The furnace excels at smelting ores and creating steel due to its high speed and its ability to process multiple items at the same time, but it is also complex in its workings and will require maintenance in order to continue functioning.<br>Slag must be removed from the machine or it will cease to function, and degrading electrodes need to be replaced over time.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace2=To form the structure, assemble it as shown on the first page, then click the cauldron with an Engineer's Hammer.<br><br>Energy is input through the three connectors at the back, and supplying the control panel at the front with a redstone signal will turn off the machine. Right-clicking the panel, 'bucket' or vat will open the interface.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace3=§lInterface:§r<br>The interface may look confusing upon first seeing it, but it's quite straight forward.<br><br>The three slots at the top are for the <link;graphite;§o§nGraphite §o§nElectrodes§r;1>.<br>The twelve slots on the left are the input slots for metals and ores. Each slot has a temperature bar next to it, representing the progress of smelting.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace4=The four slots on the right are for "additives", different materials added to the molten metal during the crafting process. An example of these would be adding Coke Dust to melting Iron in order to create Steel.<br>Inputs and additives are inserted through the two hatches at the top of the structure, inputs to the left and additives to the right of the electrodes.
ie.manual.entry.arcfurnace5=The seven slots at the bottom are six output slots and a slot for slag. Outputs are retrieved from the 'bucket' at the front of the structure, slag through the port at the back of the machine. The Arc Furnace will automatically push output and slag to connected inventories (this includes Conveyor Belts).

ie.manual.entry.excavator.name=Excavator
ie.manual.entry.excavator.subtext=Better than Dwarves
ie.manual.entry.excavator0=The Excavator is one of the pinnacles of modern engineering. It is able to dig up <link;minerals;§o§nminerals§r;0> from veins inaccessible by normal mining.
