Railgun
Velocitas Eradico
The Railgun (or more accurately the Portable Induction Catapult) is a marvel of engineering. It consists of two rails through which an electric current flows and accelerates a sled, and by that, a projectile.
The process is energy intensive but will accelerate various projectiles to high speeds.
To launch a projectile from your inventory, click and hold the use button till the charge level reaches 99, then release.

Valid projectiles include, for instance, §2iron§r and §2steel rods§r, as well as §2graphite electrodes§r.

Due to the low internal energy storage, it is recommended to use the Railgun along with a <link;powerpack;Capacitor Backpack>.
As with other IE tools, the railgun can be modified in the <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench> and be customized with <link;shader;Shaders>.<np>
<&caps>The §2Additional Capacitors§r greatly reduce the railgun's charge time.<np>
<&scope>The §2Precision Scope§r allows you to zoom in with the railgun. Sneak to use the scope and use the mouse wheel to switch between magnification levels.
