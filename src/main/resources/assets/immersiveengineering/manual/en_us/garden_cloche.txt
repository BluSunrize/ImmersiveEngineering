Garden Cloche
Localized Rainforest
<&recipe>Garden Cloches are machines designed to hasten the growth of plants in a controlled, semi hydroponic environment.<br>
It allows even agriculturally challenged engineers to grow plants quickly and automatically harvest their produce.<np>
The device accepts power through the plugs on the top and sides, and fluid and items through the other ports.<br>
When provided with power and water, the Garden Cloche will use the water to grow crops.<br>
Providing fertilizers such as <link;industrial_byproducts;Sulfur;sulfur> or <link;industrial_byproducts;Industrial Fertilizer;fertilizer> will boost the growth speed significantly. Only one fertilizer will be used at a time, and will stay dissolved in the water until it is finished.<br>
Soil and seeds are placed in the middle; each seed requires the correct soil to grow on, with dirt being automatically tilled into farmland.<br>
Produced items are stored in the slots on the right, and will be automatically output through the hatch at the front of the glass dome.
