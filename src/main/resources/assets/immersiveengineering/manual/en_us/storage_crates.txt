Storage Crates
Move that gear up!
<&crate>Wooden Storage Crates are similar to a chest in function, storing up to 27 stacks of material.<br>
Unlike chests, all the material stored within a crate will be sealed inside before it can be picked up.<np>
As with chests, crates will output a comparator signal based on the amount of items stored within.<br>
Storage crates cannot be broken by pistons, unlike Shulker Boxes.<np>
<&reinforced_crate>Reinforced Storage Crates are framed with steel, allowing them to resist the otherwise devastating dangers posed by explosions.<br>
Due to this, they will not break or drop their items when explosions happen near enough to otherwise destroy them.
