Bottling Machine
Fill 'er up!
<&multiblock>The Bottling Machine fills fluids into containers.
The structure is created as shown above, but can be mirrored. To form it, rightclick the central conveyor with an Engineer's Hammer. The direction of the conveyors is important.<np>
Fluid is input through the ports on the lower block of the metal tank. Energy is input through the port at the top of the opposing side.
Generally, the Bottling Machine will be able to fill any container that has a filled version available (bucket, glass bottle). It will also accept other items that can store fluids, like the <link;mining_drill;Mining Drill;start> or a <link;jerrycan;Jerrycan;start>.
Additionally, special recipes may be available.
