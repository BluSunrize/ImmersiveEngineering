Coke Oven
Hot topic!
<&recipe>The Coke Oven is the first important machine you will need to create in order to proceed with Immersive Engineering. Its functionality is simple, it will heat up coal or blocks of coal without supplying it with oxygen, creating Coal Coke, a carbon rich fuel. More importantly, this process creates §lCreosote Oil§r, which is used as a <link;treated_wood;preservative for wood>. Similarly you can also burn wooden logs into charcoal with this oven, albeit with a smaller yield of creosote. <&multiblock>To form a Coke Oven, arrange 27 of these blocks in a 3x3x3 cube, and rightclick one of the sides' center blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.
See the following page for a diagram.
