Electromagnet
Unnaturally attractive
<&recipe>The Electromagnet is a large coil of wire wound around a ferromagnetic core which creates a magnetic field when provided with electric current.<br>
This field attracts nearby items to the magnet, ideal for spoil collection from (mob-)farms.<br>
The magnet runs continuously while it is being supplied with power, but can be disabled with a redstone signal. This behavior can be inverted by sneaking and rightclicking it with an Engineer's Screwdriver.
