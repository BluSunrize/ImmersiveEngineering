Assembler
Some assembly required
<&multiblock>The Assembler is a complex machine capable of crafting items, similar to how a player would.
To form the structure, build it like demonstrated above and use the hammer on one of the conveyors.<np>
The conveyor you clicked will be the input side, indicated by the blue marker above it and the arrow on the side of the machine.
The Assembler allows for up to 3 recipes to be stored inside it that will be performed in order. The outputs of previous recipes can be used as inputs for following recipes.
The 3 crafting grids store the recipes, and the 18 slots below them are the inventory for materials.<np>
The input side, in addition to an item input also  features a fluid input to fill the three internal tanks of the machine.
Fluid in these tanks can be used to replace fluid containers like water buckets in recipes.
Power for the machine is input through the top center block.
