Accumulator Backpack
Do....Ray....Egon!
Energy storage takes space and some heavyweight components. As such, storing large amounts of energy in each tool individually is inefficient and makes them awkward to wield.
The Accumulator Backpack acts as a compromise, offering a centralized storage of energy for any powered tools to tap into. You construct its carrying frame with the recipe shown here. After that you can take it to the <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start> in order to place an <link;accumulators;Accumulator> inside it.
The backpack charges any tools in your hands, as well as any armor you are wearing. You can wear it like a piece of chest armor, or you may craft it with a chestpiece to attach it and gain the benefit of a power-supply as well as protection.
Note that you can not use the <link;charging_station;Charging Station> to charge the pack while it is attached to armor.
<br>The following pages detail the possible upgrades you can attach to the Accumulator Backpack.<np>
<&antenna>By attaching a §2Charging Antenna§r to the backpack, you can charge its accumulator on the go! Simply walk underneath an <link;wiring;un-insulated powerline;wire_recipes> to have the antenna connect to it.<br>
While you remain close enough to the wire, the antenna will flex and stay connected, slowly charging the accumulator from the wire network.<np>
<&induction>The §2Induction Charger§r allows the accumulator pack to charge all the items in your inventory instead of just those in your hands. Due to not using a direct wired connection however, this charging is much slower.<np>
<&tesla>As its name may suggest, the §2Miniaturized Tesla Coil§r is much like its <link;tesla_coil;larger sister>, a device that delivers dangerous shocks to nearby targets. It does so in response to the wearer being attacked, thus substituting thorny armor for electricity.
<br>Due to attaching at the top of the backpack, the coil can not be used at the same time as the Charging Antenna.
