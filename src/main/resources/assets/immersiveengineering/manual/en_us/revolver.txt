Revolver
Wanted: Dead or Alive
<&recipe>The Revolver, a more elegant weapon from a more civilized age, is an achievement of small mechanics. Small being relative here, since this weapon is chambered for 12-gauge.
Similar to the Mining Drill, the Revolver will allow for modification in the <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench>, as detailed on the last pages.

Note that firing the revolver is quite noisy, and will attract the attention of hostile mobs in the area!

There are different <link;bullets;types of ammunition;> the Revolver will accept. To load it, sneak + rightclick the weapon, then place cartridges into the slots.<np>
<&speedloader>A loaded Speedloader in your inventory will be used to refill the revolver after you've fired your last shot.
<np>
<&bayonet>By attaching a §2bayonet§r to the revolver, you outfit it with close-quarter-combat capabilities, allowing for melee damage as powerful as an Iron Sword.<np>
<&extmag>The §2Extended Magazine§r allows loading 6 more cartridges into the revolver. This magazine does not get refilled by a speedloader.<np>
<&tubes>The §2Amplifying Electron Tubes§r apply an electric shock to fired projectiles. This shock persists till it hits the target (don't ask how it works) and is passed on. The target will be stunned for a fraction of a second and all powered equipment they may be using will suffer a slight discharge.
