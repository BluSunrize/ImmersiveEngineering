Excavator
Better than Dwarves
<&excavator>The Excavator is one of the pinnacles of modern engineering. It is able to dig up <link;minerals;minerals> from veins inaccessible by normal mining. In return however, the excavator is a complex structure which requires <config;i;machines.excavator.consumption> Flux/t in order to operate.
<&wheel><&full>The structure is comprised of two pieces: The engine shown on the first page and the bucket wheel displayed on the second, which fits into the 'braces' of the engine as displayed on the previous page. The energy input for the engine is on its side, the back features a redstone control panel and the item output.<br>As the excavator digs up ores, the yield of the vein slowly decreases, but a vein of minerals can provide up to <config;i;machines.excavator.yield> blocks of ore.
