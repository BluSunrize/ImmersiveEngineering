Sawmill
I Saw What You Did
The sawmill is a machine assembly which cuts wooden logs into neatly stacked planks.<br>
The machine operates in two stages: first, the log is stripped, then the stripped law is cut apart using a <link;buzzsaw;sawblade>.<np>
<&sawdust>Both steps of the process create §2sawdust§r, which is collected and output through the port at the front of the machine.<br>
That sawdust can later be processed into paper or other useful materials, such as <link;resin_and_duroplast;Fiberboard;fiberboard>.<np>
The machine is built as shown on the first page and formed by using an §2Engineer's Hammer§r on the central sheetmetal block.<br>
Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will stop the machine, this behavior can be inverted by the §2Engineer's Screwdriver§r.<br>
To be ready for processing, you will need to craft a <link;buzzsaw;sawblade> and insert it into the slot on the back by right-clicking. Sneak and right-click to take the sawblade out again.<br>
Trying to remove the sawblade while in operation will cause injury. To ensure the machine is not in operation, disable the machine with redstone while the machine is empty.<br>
Running logs through the machine without a sawblade will create §2stripped logs§r that will not be cut apart. This process is much quicker than stripping them manually.<br>
The sawblade will be damaged while it's in use and may need to be replaced after a while.
