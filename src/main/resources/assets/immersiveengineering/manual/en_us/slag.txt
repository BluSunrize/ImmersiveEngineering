Slag Recycling
Zero Waste!
While slag is considered a waste product from the <link;crude_blast_furnace;Blast Furnace>, its properties allow it to be reused in several ways. Specialty uses are detailed on the following pages.

Slag can be made into various building blocks, including two thirds of a <link;concrete;concrete mixture>, and glass. Additionally, due to its mineral composition, slag can be used to create <link;chemicals;industrial fertilizer;fertilizer>
<&slag_gravel>§2Slag Gravel§r is slag that has been processed in the <link;crusher;Crusher> to a rough grit. It shares its behavior with any other gravel, and can be crushed further into sand.

Additionally, slag gravel contains valuable nutrients for aquatic flora. Any water plants planted on in (such as kelp) tend to grow faster than when grown on other blocks.
<&slag_glass>By melting slag in a normal furnace rather than crushing it, it becomes §2slag glass§r, a hard, semi-transparent material. It reduces the strength of light passing through it and can be used as an insulator in <link;wiring;high-voltage relays;connector_recipes>.
<&slag_bricks>§2Slag Bricks§r are slag shaped through crafting or stonecutting into glassy bricks. Due to their vitrified construction, slag bricks have a higher density and toughness than normal clay bricks, withstanding explosions more readily.

Slag Bricks can be formed into stairs, slabs, and walls, which have a small sill of baked brick on the top-most layer.
