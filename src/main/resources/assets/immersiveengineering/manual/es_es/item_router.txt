Item Router
Left foot yellow, right hand green
<&recipe>The Item Router is a block which will accept and redistribute items down filtered paths. Place it down and rightclick it to open the interface, which shows six different colour and direction coordinated filters.<np>
When an item enters the router, it will be routed to an output whose filter matches the item, or, if no matching filter is found, it routes to an unfiltered output. If the router cannot route the item in the first place, it will not allow the item to enter the router.
Items also can not be output to the side it was inserted from.<np>
The buttons above each filter can be used to further adjust how the filter works:
§2Tag-based filtering§r allows items through the filter if their tags match that of the specified item. This can be used to filter ingots of the same metal, added by different mods.
The §2NBT filter§r option allows respecting additional data on the item, such as enchantments.
The §2Damage filter§r option allows the filter to ignore the damage value of a tool or weapon.
