Mining Drill
My drill will pierce the Bedrock!
<&drill_base_recipes>The handheld, diesel-powered drill is a big advancement in mining. With exchangeable drill heads and upgrades, its speed and other properties are almost entirely modifiable.<br>
To modify it, place it in an <link;engineers_workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start>.<np>
The drill runs off of <link;industrial_fluids;Biodiesel;biodiesel> and can be filled directly in the refinery, or filled at other storage such as <link;storage_barrels;barrels> or <link;tank;large tanks>.<br>
The drill digs in an area depending on the drill head used, but can be limited to a single block with sneak or sneak-and rightclick.<np>
<&drill_head_recipes>The §2Drill Head§r determines the base §2mining level§r, §2speed§r, and §2size§r, as well as the §2attack damage§r. As you dig blocks, the drill head takes damage, but it can be repaired in an anvil.<np>
<&drill_waterproof_recipe>As the drill is powered by a combustion engine, it will not run underwater unless it is equipped with the §2Pressurized Air Tank§r. With the tank equipped, it will not only run while submerged, but also ignore the slowdown usually experienced when digging.<np>
<&drill_lube_recipe>The §2Advanced Lubrication System§r applied additional lubricant to the drill at a regular basis, decreasing the durability loss of the drill head.<np>
<&drill_damage_recipe>By adding §2Additional Augers§r to the drill, its destructive potential is increased, increasing its damage against living creatures and allowing it to run and dig faster. The upgrade stacks up to three times.<np>
<&drill_fortune_recipe>The drill's powerful action results in it wasting some of the precious mineral in the ground. By using <link;industrial_fluids;redstone acid;redstone_acid> to soften the rock first, the drill can dig out much more raw ore from blocks (akin to the §2Fortune§r enchantment).<np>
<&drill_capacity_recipe>The §2Large Fuel Tank§r allows the drill to store more fuel internally, extending the time you can use it before refilling.
