Engineer's Crafting Table
For various projects
The Engineer's Crafting Table is a simple upgrade to the normal Crafting Table. In addition to the polished, treated wood surface, it keeps the ingredient inside the crafting grid when the interface is closed.
It also features a small drawer to store some of your crafting components.
