Tank
Full to the brim!
The Tank is a multiblock that provides space for large amounts of fluid. It will store up to 512 buckets of any fluid, which can be piped in through the top or bottom block. Fluids can only be extracted from the bottom center block. Applying a redstone signal to the bottom center block will make the tank output automatically, a comparator placed there will emit a redstone signal proportional to how full the tank is. Attaching the comparator to one of the top 4 layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator. For example, a comparator attached to the second layer of a tank would not emit any signal until the tank is 1/4 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the tank is half full or more.
