<&alu>§lBauxite Ore§r can be found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.bauxite.min_y> and <config;i;ores.bauxite.max_y>, and requires a pickaxe or tool of stone or better to harvest.<br>
The raw ore will smelt into aluminium ingots, which are an integral part of high-voltage architecture.
<&lead>§lLead Ore§r can be found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.lead.min_y> and <config;i;ores.lead.max_y>, and requires a pickaxe or tool of iron or better to harvest.<br>
The raw ore will smelt into lead ingots, which are used in creating early accumulators, bullets, and industrial dyes.
<&silver>§lSilver Ore§r can be found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.silver.min_y> and <config;i;ores.silver.max_y>, and requires a pickaxe or tool of iron or better to harvest.<br>
The raw ore will smelt into silver ingots, which can be used in mirrors or alloyed with gold to create electrum, a far more effective conductor.
<&nickel>§lNickel Ore§r can be found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.nickel.min_y> and <config;i;ores.nickel.max_y>, but more abundantly below <config;i;ores.deep_nickel.max_y>. It requires a pickaxe or tool of iron or better to harvest.<br>
The raw ore will smelt into nickel ingots, which can be used in accumulators, or  alloyed with copper to create constantan, for use in <link;thermoelectric_generator;Thermoelectric Generators;start>.
<&uranium>§lUranium Ore§r can be found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.uranium.min_y> and <config;i;ores.uranium.max_y>, and requires a pickaxe or tool of iron or better to harvest.<br>
The raw ore will smelt into uranium ingots, but there are few uses for the metal. Uranium blocks can serve as heat sources for the <link;thermoelectric_generator;Thermoelectric Generator;start>, and the metal will be used in future endeavours.
