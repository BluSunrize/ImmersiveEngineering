Assembler
Some assembly required
<&multiblock>The Assembler is a complex machine capable of crafting items, similar to a player.<br>
To form the structure, build it like demonstrated above and use the Engineer's Hammer on the inwards facing conveyor.<np>
The Assembler allows for up to 3 recipes to be stored inside it that will be performed in order. The outputs of previous recipes can be used as inputs for following recipes.<br>
The 3 crafting grids store the recipes, and the 18 slots below them are the inventory for materials.<br>
The input side, in addition to an item input, also features a fluid input to fill the three internal tanks of the machine.<br>
Fluid in these tanks can be used to replace fluid containers like water buckets in recipes. Recipes to use fluids are specified by the same buckets as in the crafting table.<br>
Power for the machine is input through the plug on the top center block, and redstone control can be done through the two ports on the sides of the machine.
