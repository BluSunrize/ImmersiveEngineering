Lightning Rod
Thunderstruck!
Lightning is a phenomenon of nature. It contains a huge amount of raw power, and this lightning rod is able to harness that power.
By stacking a lot of steel fences on this multiblock, you increase the chance of a lightning bolt striking it during rain or thunderstorms.
When the steel pole is struck, the huge amounts of energy created are stored in the base of the lightning rod and then slowly distributed to the energy connections at the sides.

You can improve the chances of the Lightning Rod getting struck by creating a "net" of steel fences connected to the topmost fence.
