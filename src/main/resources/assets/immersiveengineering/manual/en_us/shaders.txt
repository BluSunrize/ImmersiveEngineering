Shaders
Blue! No, yellow!
Shaders are items you can find in the world or aquire by trading with villagers.<br>
They don't have a purpose by themselves, but they can be equipped to <link;revolver;Revolvers>, <link;mining_drill;Drills>, <link;chemical_thrower;Chemical Throwers>, <link;heavy_plated_shield;Heavy Plated Shields>, <link;railgun;Railguns>, and <link;accumulator_backpack;Accumulator Backpacks> (and possibly other things you still have to discover) to change the designs of the item.<br>
Simply put the item in an <link;engineers_workbench;Engineer's Workbench> and equip the shader in the appropriate slot.<br>
You can also apply them to a Minecart, Banner or a <link;balloon;Balloon> by rightclicking!<br>

<&grab_bag>Shader Grabbags are items containing a random shader.  They can be found in crates, traded from villagers or dropped by bosses.<br>
The rarity of the contained shader is equal to, or better than the rarity of the bag.<br>
When using a bag, you are more likely to get a shader you do not yet own than one you already possess.<br>
Shaders bags can be crafted into two bags of a lower level. This will lower your chances of getting rarer shaders but provide you with more attempts.
