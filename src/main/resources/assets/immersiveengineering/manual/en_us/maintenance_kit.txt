Maintenance Kit
On the go repairs
<&recipe>Among those Engineers that travel the world or spend much of their time in mines, one problem crystalizes itself.
Their tools require constant maintenance and carrying an entire workbench isn't viable.<br>
Fortunately, a maintenance kit can perform most minor repairs and re-configurations.<np>
A set of tools, wrapped in sturdy hemp cloth, the maintenance kit allows you to customize your tools much in the way the <link;engineers_workbench;Engineer's Workbench> does.<br>
No longer will you have to deal with resurfacing to change the head on your Mining Drill or head back to your workshop to configure your Ear Defenders.<br>
All of this can now be performed on the go with the Maintenance Kit!
