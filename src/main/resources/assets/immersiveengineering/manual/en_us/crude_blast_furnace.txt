Crude Blast Furnace
Simple Steel
<&block>The Crude Blast Furnace is used to increase the carbon contents in iron, turning it into TD LINK STEEL.<br>
 To achieve this, only pure, high-carbon fuels may be used for the furnace, such as <link;coke_oven;coal coke and charcoal>.<np>
<&outputs>Along with steel, the furnace will also create <link;industrial_byproducts;slag;slag>, which you must remove or the furnace will cease to function.<br>
While it is technically a waste product, there are various ways to recycle it, such as <link;slag_products;brick construction> or <link;concrete;concrete>.<np>
<&multiblock>To form a Blast Furnace, arrange 27 of the furnace bricks in a 3x3x3 cube, and rightclick one of the sides' center blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.<np>
The Crude Blast Furnace is §lnot§r automateable. All in- and outputs must be arranged manually through its GUI. If you want to automate the creation of steel, you should probably look into creating an <link;improved_blast_furnace;Improved Blast Furnace;>.
