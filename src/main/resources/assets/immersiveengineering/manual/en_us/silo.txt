Silo
Full to the brim!
Silos offer space for a lot of items of the same type, making them excellent for mass storage of seeds, slag or cobblestone. They have space for 41472 items, equaling the capacity of 24 chests.<np>
Items can be input through the top grate, or through the bottom port. Items must be extracted from the bottom port.<br>
Applying a redstone signal to the bottom block will make it output automatically.<br>
A comparator attached to the bottom center block will it emit a redstone signal proportional the fill of the silo.<br>
Attaching the comparator to one of the top 6 layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator.<br>
For example, a comparator attached to the third layer of a silo would not emit any signal until the tank is 2/6 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the silo is half full or more.
