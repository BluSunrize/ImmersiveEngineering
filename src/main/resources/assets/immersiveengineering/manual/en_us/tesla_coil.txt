Tesla Coil
This one goes up to 11
<&tesla_coil_recipe>The Tesla Coil started as a concept of wireless energy transfer. However, due to its potentially high loss rates and its rather interesting property of frying every living being in a 6 meter radius, it was quickly converted into an Engineer's dream of home defense.<np>
The upkeep cost of the coil is high, clocking in at 256 Flux of passive consumption plus an additional 512 every time it applies damage.<br>
The coil is disabled unless supplied with a redstone signal. Rightclicking it with an Engineer's Screwdriver will invert this behavior.<br>
In addition to damage, shocks will also apply a lingering debuff, "Stunned", preventing creatures from teleporting.<np>
Rightclicking the coil with an Engineer's Screwdriver while sneaking will toggle the coil between high- and low-power mode. To be able to do so safely the coil has to be turned off.<br>
It is in high-power mode by default. When the coil is in low-power mode it will use half the usual energy and have half the range.<np>
<&faraday_recipes>If a creature is wearing a full Faraday suit, a coil in low-power mode won't shock it, but still shoot lightning.<br>
Coils in high-power mode use special techniques to make their discharges more lethal and will cause the suit to melt, thereby increasing the damage done those wearing it and damaging the suit.<br>
The suit will also protect those wearing it from uninsulated wiring. <np>
<&tube_recipes>Fluorescent tubes glow when placed inside a strong high-frequency electric field.<br>
Such a frequency is generated by any tesla coil, so placing a tube near an active tesla coil will cause it to glow. The range is about 1.5 times the range in which you will be hit by lightning.<br>
They can be colored in the engineer's workbench and rotated by sneak + rightclicking them with an Engineer's Hammer.<br>
Tubes can be picked up directly by sneak + rightclicking with an empty hand.
