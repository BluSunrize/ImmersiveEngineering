Item Router
Left foot yellow, right hand green
<&recipe>The Item Router is designed to parcel and sort items into inventories such as chests, machines, and <link;conveyor_belts;conveyors>.<br>
Items inserted into the router will be output from matching configured sides or open sides in that order.<np>
Items can be inserted from any side, and will be output from one of the other five sides, or will disallow input if they cannot be sorted.<br>
Routers will extract from routers and inventories they are connected to when they are extracted from themselves.<br>
Colors match to a cardinal direction and a set of filters the router will sort with.<np>
The buttons above each filter can be used to further adjust how the filter works:<br>
§2Tag-based filtering§r allows items through the filter if their tags match that of the specified item. This can be used to filter all kinds and shapes of copper ingot together, or other items with similar properties.<br>
The §2NBT filter§r option allows respecting additional, special properties of the item, such as enchantments.<br>
The §2Damage filter§r option allows the filter to ignore the damage value of a tool or weapon.
