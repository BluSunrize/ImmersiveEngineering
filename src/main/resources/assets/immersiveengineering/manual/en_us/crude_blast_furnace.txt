Crude Blast Furnace
Simple Steel
<&block>The Crude Blast Furnace is used to increase the carbon contents in iron, turning it into steel. To achieve this, only pure, high-carbon fuels may be used for the furnace, specifically coal coke and charcoal.
Along with steel, the furnace will also create slag, which you must remove or the furnace will cease to function. While technically a waste product, you can use slag to create concrete.
<&multiblock>To form a Blast Furnace, arrange 27 of these blocks in a 3x3x3 cube, and rightclick one of the sides' center blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.
See the following page for a diagram. The Crude Blast Furnace is not automateable. All in- and outputs must be arranged manually through its GUI. If you want to automate the creation of steel, you should probably look into creating an <link;improved_blast_furnace;Improved Blast Furnace;>.
