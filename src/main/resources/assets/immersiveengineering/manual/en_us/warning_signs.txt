Warning Signs
Warning: Excessive signage ahead
Factories and warehouses are often grimy, unsafe, and riddled with chemicals and steam clouding the air.<br>
If reducing these hazards is inefficient, newly standardized Warning Signs can be used to warn of dangers instead.
<&sign_recipes>Warning signs can be crafted from any metal backing plate and yellow dye, to make sure the signs are visible on gloomy factory floors.<br>
Signs can be placed on any vertical block face, but cannot be placed on the floor or on the ceiling.
