Diesel Generator
Better than volume: More volume.
High-Voltage architecture might be fascinating, but an electrical grid is very useful unless there is a generator which can provide it.<br>
The Diesel Generator is the primary method of generating HV power. It will run off of <link;industrial_fluids;Biodiesel;biodiesel> or other heavy fuels, as detailed in the following pages. Due to its high output, it will consume fuel rapidly, so sufficient fuel production is a must.<np>
<&structure>The engine and generator are constructed from radiators, pipes, engineering blocks, and scaffolding as shown above and formed via activating the central generator with an Engineer's Hammer.<br>
Fuel is to be input at the bottom corners of the generator, and energy will be output to up to three plugs on the bar above the generator.<br>
The <config;i;machines.dieselGen_output>Flux/t the generator outputs will be split between all connected plugs. The generator will only run when at least one output can accept energy.<br>
The small terminal on the side will turn off the generator if supplied with a redstone signal, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Screwdriver.<br>
The following is a list of fuels the generator can accept and for how long a full bucket will power the generator: <&list>
