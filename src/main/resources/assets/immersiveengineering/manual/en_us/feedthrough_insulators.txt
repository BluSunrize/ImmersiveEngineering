Feedthrough Insulators
Hole In The Wall Tavern
<&feedthrough>Wires on their own cannot coexist with rock, or wood, or more industrial materials blocking their path.<br>
With the careful application of terracotta insulation, a solid conduit can be constructed inside of these materials to conduct power.<br>
The Feedthrough Insulator allows two connectors to be merged across one meter walls, and cannot connect more than one wire per connector.<br>
They can be created with any "normal" solid block in the middle, by right-clicking either of two connectors with an Engineer's Hammer.<br>
Non-structural connectors can be used to create feedthrough insulators for the corresponding wire type.
