Wooden Storage Crate
Move that gear up!
<&normal>Wooden storage crates are blocks quite similar to a chest. Crafted with treated wood, they offer 27 slots of storage, however, when broken, they will keep that storage, allowing you to move them together with their contents.
Like chests, they will output a comparator signal based on the amount of items stored.

<&reinforced>The reinforced storage crate offers the same capacity as a normal crate, but unlike them, these creates are impervious to explosions. No longer will pesky creepers or ill-placed mining charges destroy your valueables!
The upgrade recipe will keep the contents of the crate.
