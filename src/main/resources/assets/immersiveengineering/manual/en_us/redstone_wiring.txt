Redstone Wiring
Integration Takeover
<&coil>§2Redstone Wires§r are aluminium coated in redstone dust. The resulting cables provide an easy way to transfer redstone signals over long distance without losing signal strength.<np>
<&connector>§2Redstone Wire Connectors§r work as both relays and connectors: input and output connectors can have multiple wires connected.<br>
With the Engineer's Screwdriver, the connectors can be configured between in- and output mode and set to one of 16 coloured frequencies.<np>
<&bundled>§2Redstone Interface Connectors§r are designed to be attached to other blocks that can make use of the coloured redstone signals.<br>
The interface connector is inert and does not possess a colour, input- or output-state. Instead, it provides an interface to all 16 colors of the redstone grid.<br>
Blocks such as the <link;item_batcher;Item Batcher> and <link;logic_unit;Logic Unit> use this to output on many signals based on internal thresholds.<np>
<&probe>§2Redstone Probe Connectors§r are a compact device with many functions of the comparator.<br>
Comparator signal levels will be output on the redstone wire connected. Additionally, §lsignal thresholds§r cane be set where the probe will only output if the signal is above the threshold.<br>
Additionally, these probes can operate on two channels, sending their read signal on one and still receiving signals on another. All these settings are configured by using the Engineer's Screwdriver.<br>
Note that many of IE's multiblocks feature comparator-functionality, as described on the following pages. Where available, the redstone control surface of the multiblock is the designated spot to connect a comparator.<np>
