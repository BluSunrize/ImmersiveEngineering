Metal Press
Under Pressure!
<&multiblock>The Metal Press is an automated way of shaping metal. It uses a high pressure piston to press plates, rods, or other metal components using molds.<br>
The machine is created as shown above by using an Engineer's Hammer on the piston.<np>
Power is input through the plug on the top of the piston, and items through the conveyors in the direction of movement.<br>
The lower middle block is the redstone control port, rightclicking it with an Engineer's Screwdriver allows you to invert the redstone control.<np>
<&mold_blueprint>To actually work, the metal press requires a mold to be attached to the piston. These molds are created in the <link;engineers_workbench;§o§nEngineer's §o§nWorkbench§r> using the blueprint displayed above.<np>
<&mold_recipes>Molds are crafted as shown above, with the wirecutter taking some damage for every crafting operation. They are then inserted into the metal press by right-clicking the multiblock with a mold in hand.<np>
<&packing>The packing and unpacking molds can be used to compress 4 or 9 of the same item into their relevant storage form, as well as unpack them again. This can be utilized to store ingots as blocks, or automatically create simple blocks like Sandstone.
