Fermenter
Sk√°l!
The Fermenter is a multiblock structure that extracts ethanol from certain fruits, grains and vegetables through a fermenting process. The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central cauldron, from the side that has the Engineering Blocks.
Items can be input into the Fermenter via the two hatches at the back that are marked with blue dots. The hatch with the orange dot serves as an item output and the block below it to output fluids.
Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Screwdriver.
