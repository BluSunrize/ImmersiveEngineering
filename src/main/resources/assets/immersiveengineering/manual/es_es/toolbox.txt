Engineer's Toolbox
The Engineer's Handbag
The toolbox is a simple, carried container, used to store all the essentials of an engineer! Hovering over the relevant slots tells you what they will accept.
'Food' and 'Anything' are quite self-explanatory, 'Wiring' slots are for coils, connectors and similar items, and 'Tools' will store any IE tool as well as picks, shovels and axes! Sneaking and right-clicking allows the toolbox to be placed as a block. While placed, it's inventory can still be accessed with a rightclick. Sneaking and right-clicking again will pick the toolbox up.
